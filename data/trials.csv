Indeed, the disease has long been underdiagnosed due to a lack of effective treatment and non-invasive diagnostic methods. The prevalence of ATTRwt is estimated at 155 to 191 cases per million person-years, with an incidence of 36 cases per million person-years. Both incidence and prevalence increase with age.

The most common presentation of TTR cardiac amyloidosis is heart failure with preserved ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

The natural history of TTR cardiac amyloidosis is progression to restrictive heart disease with all the complications described above.

The median time between diagnosis and the first cardiac symptoms was 39 months. Currently, the median survival in France is approximately 3.5 years, but survival appears to be improving, with a mortality rate of 73.5% at 30 months between 2002 and 2006, compared to 15% at 60 months between 2017 and 2022.

The number of patients diagnosed with TTR cardiac amyloidosis appears to be increasing. The overwhelming majority of available data concerns patients treated in cardiology.

Some of the differences in response to medications can be explained by our genes. Genes are short sections of DNA. Each individual has over 20,000 different genes. Genes carry instructions for making the proteins needed to build things within the body including the sites where medicines act. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how our genes affect the way our body responds to medications.

Doctors can test for gene variations that might put an individual at risk of severe side-effects or mean that they are likely to receive no benefit from a specific medicine. Though not widely available in the NHS, testing allows doctors and patients to chose a different dose or avoid the medicine completely. It is estimated that almost everyone in the population (\>95%) carries at least one gene variation that affects our response to medicines.

The PHOENIX study will recruit 4,000 participants who are admitted to hospital or attend an outpatient clinic who require a new drug prescription. The new drug prescription will be one who known pharmacogenomic implications. A cheek (buccal) swab will be taken which can be used to test a large number of genes known to alter the response to medicines. Around half of the participants will be tested immediately whilst the other half will have the test after three months. The results of the test relevant to each patients new prescription will enable the doctor prescribing to determine if any changes to that medicine would be beneficial. Information will be collected about participants quality of life, subsequent admissions to hospital, medication changes and side-effects. An assessment of cost saving to the NHS will also be made.",NO,Pharmacogenomic Drug Interaction,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Pharmacogenomic testing,"Composite of ADRs and/or treatment failures, Composite of ADRS (CTCAE ≥2) and/or treatment failures (applies to specific drugs where treatment failure is captured by hospital admissions with the condition for which the index drug was commenced)., 3 months","5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) EuroQol, Assess changes in quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire administered monthly over three months to explore the impact of PGx-guided care on participants' overall well-being.

The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will comprise of ive dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.

NCT06907732,Fetoscopic Robotic Opens Spina Bifida Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06907732,FROST,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Fetal spina bifida is a common birth defect that results in hydrocephalus, motor-, bowel-, bladder- and sexual dysfunction in the child. The condition is progressive in utero. Fetal surgery between 22-26 weeks gestation has been shown to stop the gradual fetal deterioration observed in this disease and improve infant outcomes. Children with spina bifida who have undergone fetal surgery have a lower need for hydrocephalus treatment (80%-\>40%) and twice the chance to walk independently by the age of 3 years (20%-\>40%). These benefits are also sustained in the longer term.

The traditional 'open' fetal surgical approach, however, as currently offered clinically at the Ontario Fetal Centre, comes with significant risks: it increases the risk of preterm birth, carries significant maternal morbidity and results in important uterine scarring. The latter comes with a risk of uterine rupture and fetal death both in the index pregnancy and future pregnancies.

To overcome these down sides of open fetal surgery, different centers have attempted a fetoscopic approach to the surgery. Fetoscopy indeed avoids uterine scarring and is likely protective against uterine rupture but is technically complex. This results in long surgical learning curves, poor dissemination of the surgery amongst centers worldwide, longer procedures and suboptimal surgical results which translate in decreased infant benefits - particularly with regards to motor function.

The investigators have developed a fetoscopic robotic approach where they leverage the dexterity of robotic instruments to perform these complex surgeries. The team expects that this will result in easier and faster procedures with better surgical outcomes and therefore fetal benefits comparable to open fetal surgery, while at the same time avoiding the need for hysterotomy.

In this prospective exploratory phase 1 study, the investigators propose to assess the feasibility of such a robotic approach, as developed and trained on a high-fidelity phantom, in 15 patients.

In severe obesity, adipose tissue grows through the production of more adipocytes from stem cells (hyperplasia) and the increase in the size of existing adipocytes (hypertrophy). This ability of adipocytes, to maintain their functionality during tissue expansion, is critical in determining the development of obesity-related comorbidities. However, not all adipocytes are the same as adipocyte function differs greatly depending on the depot in which they are found. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying adipocyte adaptability, it is necessary to obtain a deep systems biology understanding of how signaling in different types of adipocytes regulates metabolism and function. Currently, this research group is conducting a systems biology analysis of adipocyte plasticity in obesity in mouse models, but adipose tissue biopsies from different depots in humans are lacking and needed to investigate the regulation of adipocyte function and plasticity in humans.

On the other hand, regular physical exercise has been recommended to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases, their risk factors, and other chronic conditions. Systemic vibration therapy (SVT) has been proposed as an alternative exercise modality for this population.

This project aimed to assess clinical, metabolic, physical, functional, biochemical parameters, quality of life, and sleep quality in individuals with metabolic syndrome undergoing whole-body vibration exercises on a vibratory platform.

This study aimed to evaluate clinical, metabolic, physical-functional, biochemical parameters, quality of life, and sleep quality in individuals with MSy undergoing whole-body vibration exercises. Assessments were conducted before and after the intervention and included cardiovascular responses, dyspnea, fatigue, anthropometric measurements (neck, abdominal, hip, arm, and ankle circumferences), body composition, anterior trunk and lumbar spine flexibility, and laboratory analyses (complete blood count, cholesterol profile, triglycerides, creatinine, uric acid, cortisol, glucose, insulin, growth hormone, vitamin D, and other biomarkers). Questionnaires assessed quality of life and sleep. Neuromuscular function, handgrip strength, lower limb isometric dynamometry, joint goniometry, and functional tests were evaluated.

Participants were randomized into two SVT protocol groups: Fixed Frequency (FF) and Variable Frequency (VF). Both protocols were conducted on a vibratory platform with alternating base displacement.

In the FF group, a frequency of 5 Hz was applied, with peak-to-peak displacements of 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mm, a work time of 1 minute (10s ""on"" and 50s ""off""), and 1 minute of rest in an upright position. In the VF group, frequencies varied from 5 to 16 Hz (increasing by 1 Hz per session), with a work time of 1 minute and 1 minute of rest, while peak-to-peak displacements remained the same as in the FF protocol.

Symptomatic knee OA has an incidence rate between 40 to 1,020 per 100,000 person years1 and is among the most common causes of disability worldwide. Knee arthritis pain and disability are highly comorbid wiht depression (30-50%). Currently available treatments offer only limited relief. The Pilot project aims to establish feasibility of the rTMS neuromodulation of response to Tai Chi and improvement in pain and comorbid depression in patients with knee OA. There are several ways in which the pilot project will improve scientific knowledge, and clinical practice: 1) The sequential stimulation of two targets (M1 and l-DLPFC) has not been systematically examined for the treatment of comorbid MDD and knee OA. We hypothesize that using a multi-target rTMS strategy combining M1 and l-DLPFC- active targets will be well tolerated and more effective to treat comorbid symptoms than single site rTMS to M1+l-DLPFCsham. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 1 of this proposal by comparing two experimental conditions: A) M1active and l-DLPFCactive; and B) M1active and l-DLPFCsham. 2) Identifying the relationship between improvement in pain and depression to improvement in pro-inflammatory cytokines would be novel. Adding an rTMS as a neuromodulation technique with novel stimulation sites to assist in the reduction of symptoms of pain and depression is another scalable to clinical use opportunity that will provide pilot data for future clinical trials. We will perform a pilot feasibility trial of rTMS for those presenting with knee osteoarthritis related pain and moderate to severe depression in 30 volunteers who are undergoing Tai Chi intervention.

Meniscal extrusion is the medial or lateral displacement of the meniscus beyond the edges of the tibial plateau.

Meniscal extrusion can vary in extent from minimal physiological extrusion to extrusions exceeding 10 mm. The generally accepted threshold value is considered to be 3 mm.

To date, the gold standard for measuring meniscal extrusion is T2-weighted MRI. MRI is valuable not only due to its ability to define other meniscal or knee pathologies but also because it provides good sensitivity and specificity.

Surgical treatment of meniscal extrusion is preferred in young, active, symptomatic patients and individuals with acute injuries. The treatment approach may vary depending on the underlying cause.

NCT06906692,Meningococcal Vaccination in Patients on Complement Inhibitors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06906692,Vax_MenACWY,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neurological disorder caused by autoantibodies directed predominantly against components of the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. Anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-associated neuromyelitis optica (AQP4-IgG) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by three main clinical manifestations: transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, and postrema area syndrome. Over the past five years, the FDA and EMA have approved complement inhibitor drugs for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis with anti-AChR antibody positivity and for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders with anti-AQP4 antibody positivity. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the C5 fragment of the human complement specifically and with high affinity, inhibiting its cleavage in C5a and C5b and preventing the formation of the membrane attachment C5b-9 complex (MAC) of the terminal portion of the complement cascade. This monoclonal antibody maintains the early components of complement activation (C3b), which are essential for the opsonization of microorganisms and the clearance of immune complexes. Ravulizumab is a monoclonal antibody derived from eculizumab, through the substitution of four specific amino acids, which binds specifically to complement protein C5. These substitutions increase the dissociation of the monoclonal antibody from the C5 fragment within the endosome and promote the recycling of the neonatal Fc receptor-mediated unbound antibody, extending its half-life and duration of action up to an interval of 8 weeks. Zilucoplan is a synthetic macrocyclic peptide composed of 15 amino acids that specifically binds the complement protein C5, inhibiting its cleavage into C5a and C5b by C5 convertase, which results in an underregulation of MAC assembly and cytolytic activity. In addition, this drug binds the C5b fraction of C5, creating a steric encumbrance for the binding of C5b to C6 and preventing subsequent assembly of the MAC if any C5b is formed. Due to their mechanism of action, eculizumab, ravulizumab and zilucoplan result in an increased susceptibility of the patient to systemic infections by encapsulated bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, N. meningitidis). To reduce the risk of infection, all patients should be vaccinated against serogroups A, B, C, W, Y at least 2 weeks prior to treatment; patients who start treatment before 2 weeks after administration of meningococcal vaccines should be given appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis for up to 2 weeks after vaccination. Currently, there is no global agreement on the vaccination schedule to be followed after the first dose. According to Italian guidelines, a booster dose is recommended for the monovalent vaccine only at least 1 month after the first administration and a period of antibiotic prophylaxis beyond the first two weeks after the first doses is not indicated.

2. ADL;
3. Motor sections;
4. Complications of Therapy (in the past week);
5. Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale;
6. Schwab and England ADL scale. The first four segments are made up of 42 items grouped into four subscales. The UPDRS was developed in 1987 as a gold standard by neurologists for monitoring the response to medications used to decrease the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's.

Parts 1 to 3 are scored on a 0-4 rating scale. Part 4 is scored with yes and no ratings. Higher scores show increased severity.

SUS is a Likert scale. It is often assumed that a Likert scale is simply one based on forced-choice questions, where a statement is made and the respondent then indicates the degree of agreement or disagreement with the statement on a 5 (or 7) point scale. However, the construction of a Likert scale is somewhat more subtle than this. Whilst Likert scales are presented in this form, the statements with which the respondent indicates agreement and disagreement have to be selected carefully., Day 50 (T1 - After treatment).","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The MoCA is popular screening tool used to determine if cognitive impairment is present. It takes approximately ten minutes to complete. It evaluates visuospatial skills, attention, language, abstract reasoning, delayed recall, executive function, and orientation. The MoCA covers more domains than the MMSE and, as a consequence, has greater sensitivity and specificity.

The MoCA is useful in determining a patient's level of understanding and ability., Day 0 (T0 - baseline)|Nine Hole Peg Test, The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) is used to measure finger dexterity in patients with various neurological diagnoses.

The administration of the test consists of instructing the patient to take the pegs from a container, one by one, and place them into the holes on the board, as quickly as possible, using only the hand being evaluated.

Then, instruct the patient to remove the pegs from the holes, one by one, and replace them back into the container. The evaluator should start the stopwatch as soon as the patient touches the first peg. The evaluator should stop the stopwatch once the last peg is in the container. The scoring is calculated as number of seconds it takes for the patient to complete the test. An alternative scoring could be the number of pegs placed in 50 or 100 seconds can be recorded. In this case, results are expressed as the number of pegs placed per second., Day 0 (T0 - baseline), day 50 (T1 - After treatment).|Trail Making Test, The Trail Making Test consists of two parts, A and B, each of which must be performed using a pencil. The examiner starts timing parts A and B as soon as they finish giving the instructions and the participant is given the start signal. The stopwatch should not be stopped until the participant has completed each part or the time limit for interruption has been reached. The score is calculated in this way: the time taken for completion must be recorded separately for Parts A and B. The maximum score for Part A is 100"", while 101"" indicates that the test was interrupted. The maximum score for Part B is 300"", while 301"" indicates that the test was interrupted., Day 0 (T0 - baseline), day 50 (T1 - After treatment).|Sensors-based Pointing Task, The subject sits in front of a target panel (e.g., a touch-screen monitor 24"") in order to perform a pointing task evaluation test.

The different disciplines of athletics place high physical demands on athletes. These different categories of running vary in terms of physical effort and duration, generating different levels of risk of injury. The description of the main injuries that affect elite athletes in the different athletics disciplines, as well as the identification of the specific risk factors of each discipline, will allow the identification of preventive measures to be implemented.

Objective. To identify the risk factors for tendon injury in professional long- and middle-distance athletes, according to the type of event, and to identify the best predictive model for tendon injuries based on anthropometric and athletic variables.

Method. Ambispective cohort study. 81 elite athletes will be recruited. The primary variable will be the number of tendon injuries in the last three seasons. The secondary and modifying variables will be: age (in completed years), weekly training load (in minutes), type of footwear (sneakers without carbon plate, sneakers with carbon plate, spiked sneakers without carbon plate and spiked sneakers with carbon plate), diet (balanced, high in carbohydrates, high-protein, controlled hypocaloric and adapted to the training cycle) and the regular practice of another physical activity. The possible confounding variables will be the body mass index, the date of tendon injuries in that period and the time spent as a federated athlete (in completed months).

Current treatment strategies involve conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and, in more resistant cases, biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) such as Rituximab. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20-positive B cells, is administered as an induction dose followed by maintenance therapy every six months. Standard maintenance dosing consists of 1g infusions, but lower doses may provide equivalent efficacy with fewer side effects.

The RADAR trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, non-inferiority controlled trial designed to evaluate whether a 200 mg maintenance dose of Rituximab every six months is non-inferior to the standard 1g dose in patients with RA who are in low disease activity. The study will assess disease activity using the DAS28-CRP score over 12 months, alongside various secondary endpoints, including treatment failure rates, immune responses, and adverse events.

By determining the minimum effective Rituximab dose, the study aims to optimize patient safety, reduce the risk of infections, and lower healthcare costs. This trial is particularly relevant as Rituximab has lost patent protection, making cost-effective treatment crucial, especially in low-resource settings.

The RAID score was calculated using the online EULAR toolkit. Each of the seven individual domains of the RAID is scored on a 10-item numerical rating scale, with zero being a good or low activity score and 10 a high or severe activity score.

Treatment aims to achieve and maintain remission, improve quality of life, and minimize complications. Advanced therapies, including biologics and small molecules, have significantly improved UC management by targeting specific inflammatory pathways. However, due to the multifactorial nature of UC-driven by genetic, environmental, and microbial factors-many patients do not achieve sustained remission, highlighting a therapeutic ceiling. Gut microbial dysbiosis and immune dysregulation are central to UC pathogenesis, with diet playing a critical role in influencing the gut microbiome. While biologics and small molecules have limitations, innovative approaches like combining fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and dietary interventions with advanced therapies show promise. FMT restores microbial balance, modulates immunity, and reduces inflammation, while dietary modifications, such as anti-inflammatory diets, enhance FMT efficacy by creating a favorable environment for donor microbiota engraftment.

Patients would be randomized into four different arms: FMT, AID, FMT+AID and placebo. The advanced therapies (biologics or small molecules) would be given in all four arms as standard therapy.

NCT06906432,Mechanisms of Brain-Heart Injury of Post-Intracranial Hemorrhage,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06906432,,RECRUITING,"Intracranial hemorrhage is a condition characterized by high mortality rates and suboptimal functional outcomes. It precipitates both direct brain injury and subsequent secondary injuries, including delayed cerebral ischemia, brain edema, and hydrocephalus. Complications such as cardiac injury may also arise, categorizing them within the cerebrocardiac syndrome (CCS). The clinical spectrum of CCS encompasses acute myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, all of which are associated with increased mortality and deterioration in patient status. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying both cerebral and cardiac injuries remain enigmatic, and the implications for diagnosis and therapeutic strategies are yet to be fully explored.

In this study, we propose to enroll patients with intracranial hemorrhage who will undergo conventional treatment and comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluations. Our observational research is grounded in a multimodal omics and imaging approach, aimed at investigating both local and systemic injuries subsequent to intracranial hemorrhage. This comprehensive strategy is intended to facilitate precise diagnosis, risk stratification, and clinical decision-making, while also shedding light on the pathophysiological mechanisms involved.

The primary objectives of this research are to address the following key questions:

Conducted at the Department of Endodontics, PhD Program, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Salamanca, the study included 82 participants who were randomly assigned to either the test group (preoperative dexamethasone) or the control group (postoperative ibuprofen 400 mg every 4 hours).

Pain intensity was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Results indicated significantly lower pain perception in the dexamethasone group compared to the ibuprofen group at all time points, with the majority of dexamethasone-treated patients reporting only mild pain. No adverse effects were observed in either group, and no patient required additional rescue analgesia.

The findings suggest that a single preoperative dose of dexamethasone is a safe and effective strategy for managing postoperative pain in endodontic procedures, providing superior analgesia compared to the standard postoperative ibuprofen regimen.

However, the process of aging or the sequelae of neurological diseases such as atypical Parkinson's disease (APD) compromises motor-cognitive interaction necessary for an independent lifestyle. While motor-cognitive performance has been identified as an important goal for sustained health across different clinical populations, little is known about underlying brain function leading to these difficulties and how to best target these motor-cognitive difficulties in the context of rehabilitation and exercise interventions.

The challenge of improving treatments of motor-cognitive difficulties (such as dual-tasking and navigation) is daunting, and an important step is arriving at a method that accurately portrays these impairments in an ecologically valid state. The investigators aim therefore to explore brain function during complex walking in healthy and APD by investigating the effects of age and neurological disease on motor-cognitive performance and its neural correlates during three conditions of complex walking (dual-task walking, navigation and a combination of both) using non-invasive measures of brain activity (functional near infrared spectrometry, fNIRS) and advanced gait analysis in real time in older healthy adults and people with APD.",NO,"Gait Disorders, Neurologic|Atypical Parkinson Disease|fNIRS|Aging","OTHER: Assessment of brain activity with fNIRS and behavioural assessments (motor, motor-cognitive and cognitive) during three complex walking conditions.","Functional near infrared spectrometry (fNIRS), The measurement of changes in concentration of HbO and HHb in the prefrontal cortex will be assessed using a NIRSPORT 2 (NIRx Medizintechnik, Berlin, Germany) device., Baseline|Gait performance during all conditions, Gait variables such as stride time and/or velocity will be analyzed with the APDM mobility system., Baseline|Dual-task performance-reaction time, Cognitive performance of the dual task will be assessed as errors in the response to the Auditory Stroop task., Baseline","Resting-state functional near infrared spectrometry (rsfNIRS), The measurement of changes in concentration of HbO and HHb in the whole cortex will be assessed using a NIRSPORT 2 (NIRx Medizintechnik, Berlin, Germany) device during 2x 10min of rest, while seated in a comfortable chair., Baseline|Cognitive function- composite score, The cognitive test battery comprised the following tests: The Color-Word Interference Test (CWIT), Verbal Fluency, Trail Making Test (TMT), Ray Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).

NCT06906237,Scarless Advanced Breast Extended Oncoplasty: The ScarABEO Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06906237,ScarABEO,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Breast conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is the gold standard treatment for early breast cancer. Cases with unfavorable tumor volume to breast volume ratio or challenging localizations are at higher risk of margin infiltration or poor aesthetic outcomes. While margin infiltration represents one of the strongest predictors of local recurrence, unappealing cosmetic results may significantly impair survivors' quality of life. Over the past two decades, the adoption of oncoplastic breast conserving surgery (OBCS) techniques has shown promise in improving both oncological and aesthetic outcomes after breast cancer surgery. Partial breast volume reconstruction (PBR) after OBCS is obtained through volume displacement (which involves remodelling and redistributing glandular tissue) and volume replacement (when the volume used to reconstruct the defect comes from an extramammary site) techniques.

One of the greatest examples of volume replacement techniques in breast surgery involves the use of chest wall perforator flaps (CWPF). The use of these well-vascularized dermo-adipose flaps offers oncologically safe wide resection while obtaining excellent cosmetic outcomes. It is particularly suitable for patients with non-ptotic small to medium-sized breasts and cases with an unfavorable tumor volume to breast volume ratio. CWPFs can decrease mastectomy rates in breast cancer surgery, thus avoiding the disadvantages associated with implant-based reconstruction. Consequently, the need of contralateral simmetrization is also diminished.

CWPFs are vascularized by perforator arteries that arise from the chest wall (mainly branches of the axillary artery, or intercostal arteries deriving from the internal mammary artery). While cadaver labs and radiologic studies demonstrated a reliable and coherent localization of perforator arteries, the use of Doppler Ultrasound is often required to localize the perforators and test their reliability. Compared to the traditional myocutaneous flaps (such as the latissimus dorsi flap), CWPFs spare the underlying muscles minimizing donor site morbidity and enabling rapid post-operative recovery, low post-operative complication rates, post-operative pain, and loss of function. All these advantages may result in high levels of patients' satisfaction. Additionally, CWPFs avoid the microsurgical anastomoses required for free flaps.

All breast quadrants defects could be restored with CWPFs, with the Thoraco-Dorsal Artery Perforator (TDAP), Lateral-Thoracic Artery Perforators (LTAP) and Lateral Intercostal Artery Perforator (LICAP) Flaps particularly suitable for reconstructing lateral quadrant; the Anterior Intercostal Artery Perforator (AICAP) Flap for the lower quadrants and the Internal Mammary Artery Perforator (IMAP) Flaps for volume defects at inner quadrants.

Although existing literature reports promising results, the use of CWPFs remains emerging, and OBCS with CWPFs is currently limited to select high-volume breast centers. The collection of robust clinical data is essential to validate these potential advantages and facilitate the broader adoption of this technique.

This multicentric retrospective observational study aims to collect evidence about the surgical and oncological outcomes of OBCS with CWPFs, to evaluate the potential benefits associated with the use of this innovative technique.",NO,Breast Cancer|Oncoplastic Breast Surgery|Oncoplastic Breast-conserving Surgery|Chest Wall Perforator Flap,,"Margin infiltration rate, Margin infiltration rate in Patients with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ who underwent Oncoplastic Breast Conserving Surgery with Chest Perforator Flaps, Perioperative","Re-excisions rate, Re-excisions rate due to positive margins rate on surgical specimen, Up to 24 weeks|Total resection volume and final breast volume ratio, Perioperative|Post-operative complication rates, Up to 24 weeks|Post-operative breast symmetry, One year|Disease-free survival, Two years|Overall Survival, Two years",,Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,250,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,CET ANV 2024-23,2025-05-01,2025-09-01,2025-12-01,2025-04-02,,2025-04-02,"Veneto Institute of Oncology, Padova, 35127, Italy",

Secondary objectives include assessing changes in muscle fatigue, muscle function of the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis, physiological changes in blood lactate concentration and oxygen saturation, and intramuscular structural changes through ultrasound before and after the intervention.

The study will recruit professional athletes from disciplines that require anaerobic muscle metabolism, such as cycling, athletics, triathlon, CrossFit, and duathlon. Participants must be federated athletes who train at least four times per week and actively compete at regional, national, or international levels. Exclusion criteria include recent sports injuries preventing test performance, prior exposure to CRET therapy, allergies to conductive gel, language barriers, participation in other research studies, or ongoing pharmacological treatment that could interfere with measurements.

Participants will attend four study sessions, divided into two sets of two consecutive days. On the first day, they will perform the Wingate test followed by the assigned post-competition massage with either CRET therapy or a placebo intervention. On the second day, they will repeat the Wingate test. After a three-week washout period, participants will switch to the opposite group.

Despite numerous studies, finding effective treatment strategies has been challenging. One possible reason for this is that treatments may not have been tested on the specific groups of people who would benefit most. A method was developed to identify people with neck pain who are likely to see significant improvements from a manipulation technique used by physical therapists, called cervical spine thrust joint manipulation. The investigators believe that patients identified as likely responders to cervical spine manipulation will show greater improvements in disability. The investigators aim to test whether this method works with different patients and therapists across the country through a multicenter randomized clinical trial. In this study, 140 patients with primary complaints of neck pain will be enrolled from 20 clinical sites. Designed with stringent criteria for inclusion, this study is a testament to our commitment to participant safety and the effectiveness of the treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) one group will receive 2 sessions of cervical spine manipulation followed by 3 sessions of exercise, and (2) the other group will receive 2 sessions of gentle hands-on treatment followed by 3 sessions of exercise. The primary goal is to measure changes in disability 4 weeks after starting treatment, with follow-ups after one week, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months to assess both immediate and long-term effects. By providing crucial data on the reliability of our method in identifying patients who will benefit most from cervical spine manipulation, this study has the potential to significantly enhance decision-making leading to rapid improvement.

A total of 100 patients with degenerative meniscal tears will be enrolled in the observational study and treated according to the current standard of care which consists in an arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in all the three clinical operative Unit involved in the project.

Demographic, anamnestic and clinical data (age, gender, BMI, habits, co-morbidities, pharmacological treatments) of the patients included in the observational clinical study will be collected.

Clinical routine assessments will be performed before surgery to assess the overall condition of the joint. A morphological profiling based on the MRI will be performed on patients prior or after the surgery since no change in knee morphology is expected to occur. Clinical routine assessments will be performed also after treatment to check for possible joint changes after the surgery.

Before surgery, peripheral blood samples from each patient enrolled in the observational study will be collected. Total blood count will be registered and included in the set of the patients' data. Total RNA will be purified from the blood samples and integrity of each RNA sample will be evaluated to exclude possible degradation during the procedure.Total RNA will be preamplified to perform the qRT-PCR-based analysis sifting a well-described set of 754 miRNAs panel known for their involvement in several joint and blood cell types' homeostasis and activation.

Patients will be clinically and radiologically monitored at short- and long-term to evaluate the possible onset of OA post-meniscectomy. Any possible relevant clinical data and adverse events encountered during the patient's clinical path will be tracked.

Patients will be assigned to categories based on the PEARL registry data and their clinical outcome post- meniscectomy. This will help identifying possible risk factors and pre-treatment markers associated to the susceptibility of patients to develop post-meniscectomy OA.

These affect the quality of life of both children and parents. As of now, interventions available to manage ASD-related behaviors rely heavily on the services of professionals who are often difficult to access. What is even more striking is that there are currently no approved medications to treat the core symptoms of ASD. There is an important need for additional strategies to manage severity of ASD and to develop new treatments.

Targeting the bacteria living in the intestine, named 'gut microbiota', by using probiotics is an avenue that has been proposed by other groups to improve behaviors associated with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, these studies have important limitations, pressing the need for robustly designed interventions.

Previously, the PROBI-O-TISM pilot study was conducted at CHU Sainte-Justine. The investigators confirmed that the Bio-K+ probiotic beverage is acceptable and safe for autistic children and that the proposed study protocol is feasible. The study also led to promising preliminary results suggesting a beneficial effect of the probiotics on behaviors, gastrointestinal symptoms and sleep.

The proposed study will answer the question: ''Does supplementing with Bio-K+ probiotics reduce the severity of autistic behaviors and comorbidities in children with a diagnosis of ASD? '' The investigators will use a solid study design, a double-blinded randomized controlled-trial with placebo, to test the efficacy of a 14-week treatment with daily Bio-K+ probiotic supplement in children aged 4 to 11 years old. The investigators will also study the impact of the supplementation on other parameters such as quality of life, gut microbiota and brain signaling.

New imaging techniques, which can measure processes in the body without surgery, are opening the door to a more precise approach to medicine. Instead of relying on general probabilities, this technology allows us to analyze specific factors in a person's health, leading to better predictions and targeted treatments. One key challenge in medicine today is reducing ""residual individual risk""-the remaining health risks that current treatments don't fully address. This involves understanding how factors like age, sex, genetics, and environment affect our health, particularly when it comes to conditions like heart and liver disease. By using imaging to distinguish between normal aging and disease, we can better assess individual health risks.

The current project will create a large collection of medical images linked with health data from a broad population across France. Using advanced, non-invasive techniques such as MRI and ultrasound, researchers will analyze the heart, blood vessels, and liver in detail, considering factors like gender and health risk profiles.

However, these biomarkers do not fully capture the viral activity or predict clinical outcomes. Recently, new biomarkers like HBcrAg and HBV RNA have emerged, showing promise for better understanding the natural history of the infection and guiding treatment decisions. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the predictive role of these biomarkers (HBcrAg, HBV RNA) in HBV-infected patients, focusing on their association with HBsAg seroconversion and their ability to predict clinical events like cirrhosis and HCC. Secondary objectives include describing the clinicobiological characteristics of patients, determining HBV genotypes, characterizing the impact of HBV on the host's transcriptome, and studying the biomarkers' role in different phases of the infection and treatment.

NCT06905886,Resting Energy Expenditure in Postmenopausal Women,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06905886,MenoBOLISM,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Obesity and its associated comorbidities are rising at an alarming rate, particularly among postmenopausal women. Menopause, characterized by a decline in estradiol and progesterone levels, is often accompanied by weight gain. Fear of this weight gain is a major reason why many women hesitate to initiate or continue menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), with discontinuation often occurring within the first few months. However, scientific evidence on whether MHT influences weight gain remains inconclusive. A Cochrane Review found no significant effect of estrogen or combined estrogen-progestogen therapy on menopause-related weight gain, suggesting that aging and lifestyle changes play a more prominent role.

While the effects of estrogen on energy intake have been well-documented, data on its impact on energy expenditure-particularly resting energy expenditure (REE), the largest component of total energy expenditure-are scarce. Several studies suggest that sex hormones may influence REE, as observed in premenopausal women, where REE increases during the luteal phase when estradiol and progesterone levels are high. However, findings on this topic remain inconsistent, and it is unclear whether estrogen or progesterone plays the primary role. Research on the effects of exogenous hormone administration, such as MHT, on REE is extremely limited, with existing studies producing mixed results. Additionally, the potential influence of progestogens on REE has been largely overlooked. Given that a low REE is a strong predictor of weight gain and obesity, understanding the effects of MHT on REE is crucial.

This observational clinical trial aims to investigate the precise effect of MHT (estradiol + progesterone) on REE in postmenopausal women with an indication for MHT. Secondary objectives include examining MHT's impact on energy intake, physical activity energy expenditure, performance capacity, body composition, core body temperature, serum hormone profiles (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, progesterone), glucose metabolism, fasting blood lipid levels, and miRNA expression (miR-370 and miR-29b, which are involved in lipid and glucose metabolism). Additionally, the study will assess various aspects of subjective well-being and quality of life.

By addressing the current gaps in scientific knowledge, this study seeks to provide robust evidence on the role of MHT in energy metabolism, potentially reshaping perspectives on its risks and benefits in postmenopausal women.",NO,Postmenopause|Energy Expenditure|Hormone Replacement Therapy,,"Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), Difference in absolute REE (kcal/day) before hormonal substitution and after four weeks of MHT, 4 weeks",,,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,37,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2022-01570,2025-08,2026-08,2027-02,2025-04-02,,2025-04-02,"University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland; Department of Gynecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, Bern, 3010, Switzerland",

Fear of childbirth is a common issue that affects women's health and well-being before, during, and after pregnancy. The thought that childbirth will be painful triggers fear of childbirth. Fear of childbirth is closely related to the perception of traumatic birth. Antenatal education is important in coping with childbirth pain and traumatic birth pain, but the aim of adult education is not just to inform, but also to change individuals' perspectives on events. The transformative learning theory is a model used to change individuals' perspectives on events. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antenatal education based on the transformative learning theory on traumatic birth perception, fear of childbirth, and birth preparedness in pregnant women. The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial with 54 participants. Data collection forms included a personal information form, the Traumatic Birth Perception Scale, the Prenatal Self-Assessment Scale, and the Wijma Birth Expectancy/Experience Scale. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 23.0 (Chicago, Illinois) version was used for data analysis. Histogram and Q-Q plots, and the Shapiro-Wilk test were used to assess the normality of the data distribution. Descriptive data regarding women's demographic characteristics were analyzed using frequencies, percentages, and mean values. Differences in demographic characteristics between groups were examined using the independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-square test.

It consists of 13 items that encompass the thoughts and emotions, such as anxiety, fear, and concern, that a woman experiences when thinking about childbirth. For each item, respondents rate their feelings on a scale from 0 (""no fear"") to 10 (""extreme fear""). The total average score indicates the level of traumatic birth perception. The lowest and highest possible scores on the scale are 0 and 130, respectively. As the score increases, it reflects a higher perception of traumatic birth. The score ranges are as follows: 0-26 indicates very low, 27-52 low, 53-78 moderate, 79-104 high, and 105-130 indicates very high levels of traumatic birth perception.

NCT06905795,Screening and Intervention of MASLD in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06905795,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children and adolescents has recently been renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It has become one of the leading chronic liver diseases in children. The prevalence of MASLD is 6.3% among the general pediatric population and 40.4% among overweight and obese children, with an increasing trend each year. MASLD increases the risk of various metabolic diseases and can eventually lead to liver fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, contributing to the disease burden.

Previous work by our project team using machine learning methods has identified that fasting insulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) have good predictive value in overweight and obese children, with a recommendation that children with a WHtR ≥ 0.48 should undergo further screening. However, external validation is still required to improve the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of this screening approach.

Till now, there are no approved drug treatments for paediatric MASLD, and lifestyle interventions (such as restricting energy intake and increasing physical activity) are the main therapeutic strategies. However, existing studies face limitations, such as small sample sizes, diverse intervention methods, lack of standardization, and short intervention durations, which hinder their clinical application. Therefore, it is essential to explore effective health lifestyle intervention models tailored to children.

This study aims to: First, optimizing the screening and treatment pathway, assess the cost-effectiveness and applicability of WHtR as a screening tool, and develop a tiered screening system suitable for Chinese children; Second, integrating school, clinic, family, and community resources to establish a multifacted lifestyle intervention model and evaluate its efficacy.",NO,MASLD - Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease|Children,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fibroscan test|BEHAVIORAL: Nutrition guidance|BEHAVIORAL: Increase physical activity|OTHER: Health education,"Change from Baseline in Waist-to-Height Ratio at 12 Months, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months","Change from Baseline in Controlled Attenuation Parameters at 12 Months, Controlled Attenuation Parameters will be detected by Fibroscan HANDY, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Change from Baseline in Liver Stiffness Measurement at 12 Months, Liver Stiffness Measurement will be detected by Fibroscan HANDY, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Change from Baseline in Blood Lipids at 12 Months., Include TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Change from Baseline in Fasting Blood-Glucose at 12 Months, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Change from Baseline in Fasting Insulin at 12 Months, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Change from Baseline in Liver Enzyme at 12 Months, Inlude ALT, AST, and GGT., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Change from Baseline in BMI at 12 Months, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Change from Baseline in BMI Z score at 12 Months, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Change from Baseline in Cardiorespiratory Endurance at 12 Months, Cardiorespiratory Endurance will be assessed by 20 meter shuttle run test., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months",,Ningbo No. 1 Hospital,Peking University,ALL,CHILD,NA,270,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",2024S023,2025-04-01,2026-05-31,2027-05-31,2025-04-01,,2025-04-01,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315010, China",

NCT06905639,Impact of Physical Exercise on Lymphedema Related to Breast Cancer: Assessment Using Thermography,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06905639,,COMPLETED,"Study Type: Clinical Trial

Primary Purpose: To determine whether physical exercise improves or prevents lymphedema in breast cancer patients.

Description of the Participant Population/Main Condition: The study is aimed at women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and have experienced post-treatment lymphedema or are at risk of developing it. The target population includes adults aged 18 to 70 who have been diagnosed with this condition following their breast cancer treatment.

Main Research Questions:

Does physical exercise improve or prevent lymphedema in women with breast cancer? What are the effects of physical exercise on the reduction of arm volume affected by lymphedema? What are the effects of physical exercise on the reduction of perceived disability in the arm affected by lymphedema?

Hypothesis:

Physical exercise intervention significantly reduces lymphedema symptoms, such as arm volume. Physical exercise prevents the progression of lymphedema in women with breast cancer.

Comparison Group: Researchers will compare results between the experimental group (which will undergo physical exercise) and the control group (which will receive no intervention) to determine if physical exercise has a significant impact on the improvement or prevention of lymphedema.

Participant Tasks:

The experimental group will follow a supervised physical exercise program for a specific period. The control group will receive no intervention and will be monitored with standard follow-up care without exercise. Participants will be evaluated before and after the study period to measure the progression of lymphedema, including arm volume measurement and surface skin temperature using thermography.",NO,Breast Neoplasms|Lymphedema|Thermography|Exercise,BEHAVIORAL: Aerobic and Strength Exercise,"Perimeters, The perimeter of the arm affected by lymphedema will be measured to assess the reduction in lymphedema volume in the participants.

This questionnaire measures limitations in daily activities related to the arm affected by lymphedema. It will be administered before and after the intervention to assess changes in mobility and functional capacity following physical exercise. In the DASH questionnaire, higher scores indicate greater disability, while lower scores indicate less disability, 10 weeks","Bicipital and Tricipital Skinfolds, Bicipital and tricipital skinfold measurements will be taken to assess the body composition and body fat percentage of the participants. These measurements will help analyze the impact of physical exercise on the reduction of body fat and potential improvements in muscle mass, especially in the area affected by lymphedema. The skinfolds will be measured in millimeters (mm), and body fat percentage will be measured in percentage (%)., 10 weeks|RS-14 Questionnaire (Resilience Scale for Adults), The RS-14 Questionnaire (Resilience Scale for Adults) will be used to assess resilience in the participants. This questionnaire will allow us to observe whether the physical exercise intervention has an effect on the participants. In the RS-14 questionnaire, higher scores indicate greater resilience, while lower scores indicate lower resilience.

Maximum and Minimum Scores: The questionnaire consists of 14 items, each rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 7, where:

1 means ""strongly disagree"" 7 means ""strongly agree""

The scores are summed to obtain a total score, with a scoring range of 14 to 98:

It will be administered before and after the intervention to evaluate whether physical exercise influences the improvement of emotional intelligence in patients with lymphedema.

Scores: The TMMS-24 questionnaire consists of 24 items, distributed across three dimensions:

Emotional Perception Emotional Understanding Emotional Regulation

Each item is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where:

1 means ""strongly disagree"" 5 means ""strongly agree""

Scores are summed within each dimension, and a total emotional intelligence score is obtained, with score ranges indicating different levels of emotional ability:

Low score: Indicates lower capacity in emotional perception, understanding, and regulation.

High score: Indicates greater capacity in these areas., 10 weeks|MOS Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS), The MOS Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) questionnaire will be used to measure the level of social support received by the participants. This questionnaire will help identify how social support may influence the response to physical exercise.

Scores: The MOS-SSS questionnaire consists of several questions related to different dimensions of social support, such as emotional, instrumental, and relational support. Responses are rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where:

1 means ""None"" (indicating a very low level of social support) 5 means ""A lot"" (indicating a very high level of social support) Scores are summed to obtain a total score, and in this case, higher scores indicate a higher level of social support, while lower scores indicate a lower level of social support., 10 weeks|Anthropometric measurements, Changes in the participants' weight will be evaluated throughout the study.

NCT06905535,Corrected Carotid Flow Time for Predicting Spinal Anesthesia-induced Hypotension,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06905535,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Spinal anaesthesia is a standard technique frequently preferred for caesarean section. However, spinal anaesthesia-induced hypotension remains a critical problem causing undesirable maternal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and dyspnoea and adverse consequences for umbilical acidosis and the fetus. One of the reasons aggravating hypotension is aortocaval compression of the growing uterus and consequent decrease in preload and stroke volume . Therefore, left lateral tilt position is recommended in pregnant women after the 20th gestational week to prevent supine hypotension. This position decreases uterine compression on the vena cava and increases venous return to the heart and thus stroke volume. Recently, carotid artery Doppler has been used to assess stroke volume. Many studies have shown that carotid corrected flow time increases significantly after expansion of intravascular volume in hypovolaemic patients . In one study, it was reported that the change in carotid artery blood flow time induced by passive leg raising predicts fluid sensitivity in critically ill patients. It has been reported that changes in carotid artery blood flow time against hemodynamic interventions (such as Trendelenburg position) reflect maternal hypovolemic status and distinguish hypovolemic patients with a higher risk of spinal anesthesia-related hypotension. The investigators also think that the left lateral tilt position may increase the corrected carotid flow time by affecting hemodynamics and may differentiate the patient with a high risk of hypotension.",NO,Hypotension,,"predictive value of the carotid flow time alteration, rate of prediction, 10-15min",,,Selcuk University,,FEMALE,ADULT,,50,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,carotis flow,2025-04-01,2025-05-30,2025-06-30,2025-04-01,,2025-04-01,,

China is among the countries with the highest TB burden, ranking third globally for total TB cases and second for drug-resistant TB cases. PAN-TB is an innovative concept in TB treatment, aiming to develop a universal regimen effective for all forms of active TB, including both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains. The primary goal of the PAN-TB regimen is to simplify the treatment process, reduce costs, and improve treatment success rates. The ideal Target Regimen Profile (TRP) for PAN-TB includes superior efficacy compared to standard treatment for non-drug-resistant TB, a reduced treatment duration from the current 4-6 months to 2-3 months, and improved safety and tolerability. This project aims to explore a new ultra-short-course treatment regimen for both drug-sensitive (DS-TB) and drug-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB), which aligns with the latest trends in TB treatment both domestically and internationally. The regimen also has significant practical implications for enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing patient burden.

Epcoritamab, a type of bispecific T-cell engager, binds to a protein called CD3, which is found on T cells (a type of white blood cell). It also binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (another type of white blood cell) and some lymphoma cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Oxaliplatin is in a class of medications called platinum-containing antineoplastic agents. It damages the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as ifosfamide, etoposide phosphate, cytarabine, and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Dexamethasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. An autologous HCT is a procedure in which blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) are removed, stored, and later given back to the same person.

NCT06905405,The Use of Advanced Imaging in HFpEF,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06905405,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) causes symptoms of breathlessness and leg swelling. It is associated with significant number of hospital admissions and could lead to the patient's death. In HFpEF, the pumping function of the heart is normal but the heart is too stiff to fill properly. The first line investigation is an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiography). A number of parameters are assessed that indicate stiffness within the heart or raised pressures within the heart. However, most of these parameters lack sensitivity which can make HFpEF difficult to diagnose. The best test is to invasively measure the pressures in the heart at rest and with exercise in a procedure called heart catheterisation. However, this is invasive and not readily available. As a result, HFpEF is significantly under diagnosed meaning many patients do not get access to disease specific treatment that may improve symptoms and quality of life. There are a number of new imaging techniques that may help us to better identify HFpEF . However, it is not currently known how to best apply them in clinical practice In this study, we will recruit patients presenting to the HF clinic at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals who have symptoms of HFpEF but whose diagnosis remains unclear after initial assessment. The impact of their symptoms will be assessed with the use of a quality of life (QoL) questionnaires and a six-minute walk test (6MWT). They will undergo advanced imaging with a specialist echocardiogram and a cardiac MRI scan. If they are found to have features of HFpEF, they will be started on disease specific treatment. All patients will be followed up after six months to see if they have any symptomatic or functional improvement.

The main question it aims to answer is in patients with initial caries lesions will Moringa Oleifera varnish have same remineralization efficacy as MI Varnish after 6 months follow up? MI varnish will be used as a comparator as it has been shown in many studies to be superior to fluoride varnish with NaF alone in arresting early caries lesions.

Lesion activity can be detected through surface topography and texture; an active lesion in enamel is rough upon probing with the tip of a ball ended probe, unlike the inactive lesion which appears to be shiny and smooth upon probing. These surface phenomena are the visual representation of the demineralization activity of the dental biofilm. Due to scattering of light, rough active non-cavitated enamel lesions appear dull to the naked eye, unlike the surfaces of inactive lesions which appears glossy due to specular reflection.

An alternative approach to the intraoperative administration of high potency opioids to achieve antinociception during surgery is combining general anesthesia with regional anesthesia. Modern general anesthesia aims to avoid an overdose of opioid analgesics and reduce side-effects of opioid administration. Quality and safety of general anesthesia are of major clinical importance and can be improved by adjusting the opioid analgesics to the optimal individual dose needed.

In current clinical practice, opioid dosage is usually determined by clinical judgment. However, different monitoring devices estimating the effect of nociception during unconsciousness have become commercially available. One of the most recent commercially available nociception indices is the Nociception Level Index (NOL). Until today, there is conflicting evidence on whether guiding sufentanil administration by NOL monitoring, which is the intended use of the nociception index, affects postoperative pain level in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the amount of postoperatively administered opioids, and the quality of postoperative recovery in patients with a combination of general and regional anesthesia. This study aims to investigate the clinical performance of intraoperative NOL monitoring and determines whether guiding sufentanil administration by NOL monitoring - compared to routine care - reduces either postoperative pain level in the PACU, postoperative opioid consumption in the PACU or postoperative opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after the operation in patients having trauma and orthopedic surgery with combined general and regional anesthesia.",NO,"Nociceptive Pain|Pain, Postoperative|Analgesia, Postoperative|Anesthesia Recovery Period|Opioid Use",PROCEDURE: NOL (Nociception Level Index)|OTHER: Control (Standard treatment),"Postoperative pain level in the PACU, Compares the postoperative pain level (NRS 0-10) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) between groups., 1 day|Postoperative administered dose of opioids during the PACU stay, Compares the postoperative administered dose of opioids in morphine equivalents during the PACU stay (mg) between the groups., 1 day|Postoperative administered dose of opioids in the first 24 hours after the operation, Compares the postoperative administered dose of opioids in morphine equivalents in the first 24 hours after the operation (mg) between the groups., 2 days","Intraoperative sufentanil consumption, Compares intraoperative sufentanil consumption \[μg/kg/min\] between the groups., 1 day|Intraoperative norepinephrine consumption, Compares intraoperative cumulative dose of norepinephrine consumption \[μg/kg/min\] between the groups., 1 day|Time to extubation, Compares the time from end of narcotics to extubation \[min\] between the groups., 1 day|Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), Compares the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (%) between the groups., 1 day|PACU stay, Compares the length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (min) between the groups., 1 day|Postoperative pain level 24 hours after the operation, Compares the postoperative pain level at rest 24 hours after the operation (NRS 0-10) between the groups., 1 day|Quality-of-Recovery QoR-15 Score, Compares the quality of postoperative recovery measured by the Quality-of-Recovery QoR-15 Score (0-120 points) 24 hours after the operation between the groups., 2 days",,Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,240,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",TEMP522873-BO-ff,2025-04,2025-12,2026-01,2025-04-01,,2025-04-01,"Department of Anesthesiology; Center of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, 20246, Germany",

Among these proteins, erythropoietin and interleukin-3 play a major role. Similarly, proteins involved in iron metabolism (erythroferrone, hepcidin, ferroportin, transferrin, ferritin) influence erythrocyte production more or less directly. The regulation of erythropoiesis is a fine, complex mechanism involving a large number of players, not only through the stimulation of hypoxia pathways to control erythropoietin synthesis, but also through the availability of iron, an essential element for erythropoiesis. Excessive erythrocyte production can lead to polycythemia, the causes of which are varied, primary or secondary, acquired or constitutional. The aim of this work is the descriptive study (quantitative and/or qualitative) of the various proteins involved in the regulation of erythropoiesis in patients with polycythemia.

NCT06905093,Eccentric or Concentric Contralateral Training in Rehabilitation After Shoulder Surgery With Elbow Immobilization,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06905093,EXC-IMMO,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This clinical study investigates whether contralateral training (exercising the non-immobilized arm) can help preserve muscle strength and mass in patients recovering from shoulder surgery with elbow immobilization. Immobilization is often necessary to prevent further injury, but it can lead to significant muscle loss and reduced strength, delaying recovery and increasing healthcare costs. Recent studies suggest that training the non-immobilized arm may help maintain muscle function in the immobilized arm, particularly when using eccentric exercises (where muscles lengthen under tension). This study aims to compare the effects of eccentric and concentric (shortening) contralateral training versus standard care (no training) in patients undergoing shoulder surgery.

The study involves 4 visits: pre-surgery assessments, a 4-6 weeks' immobilization period with or without training, and follow-ups at the end of immobilization, 6 weeks' post-immobilization, and 17 weeks' post-immobilization. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group receiving standard care, a group performing eccentric training, or a group performing concentric training. Muscle strength, mass, and function will be measured using tests such as isometric strength, ultrasound imaging, and functional scores.

The hypothesis is that eccentric contralateral training will better preserve neuromuscular function and muscle mass in the immobilized arm compared to both standard care and concentric training. This could lead to faster recovery and improved outcomes for patients.

NCT06905015,Stroke Volume Variation Versus Central Venous Pressure Guidance for Reducing Perioperative Blood Loss During Open Liver Resection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06905015,,RECRUITING,"Liver resection is a major surgery that can be associated with significant intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion. Among high-volume centers, median intraoperative blood loss ranges between 300-800 ml. Excessive blood loss is a strong independent predictor of worsened postoperative outcomes, increasing morbidity and mortality rates by 20%-35%. Additionally, perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions are associated with deleterious outcomes, including tumor recurrence and increased rates of complications and death.

The liver is a highly vascular organ with minimal vascular resistance, receiving up to 25% of cardiac output and pooling 20% of the splanchnic blood. Hepatic veins are a common source of venous hemorrhage. The pressure in the hepatic veins is directly correlated with the pressure in the vena cava and reducing cardiac preload results in decreased hepatic vein congestion. Therefore, low central venous pressure anesthesia (typically below 5 mmHg) can reduce the pressure gradient for retrograde venous bleeding, facilitate the outflow of blood from hepatic veins, and decrease blood volume and pressure in the liver. This anesthetic method is the standard technique to minimize blood loss during liver resection.

Central venous pressure was the static parameter used to indicate the right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDI) and was believed to be correlated with volume status. Despite this, central venous pressure did not reliably predict preload responsiveness due to the curvilinear shape of the ventricular pressure-volume curve, which indicates a poor relationship between ventricular filling pressure and volume. Additionally, the placement of a central venous catheter could lead to serious complications such as arterial cannulation, pneumothorax, and infection.

Arterial waveform analysis is dynamic hemodynamic monitoring based on the interaction between the heart and lungs in patients with mechanical ventilation. Stroke volume variation (SVV) is one aspect of arterial pressure waveform analysis and is a less invasive alternative technique for guiding preload status and fluid management in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.

In liver resection, several anesthetic methods are used to achieve low central venous pressure (CVP \< 5 mmHg) during the liver parenchymal dissection phase. These methods include intraoperative volume restriction, administration of venodilators or vasodilators, the use of forced diuresis with furosemide, and the implementation of hypovolemic phlebotomy. As mentioned, central venous pressure is a static hemodynamic monitoring parameter and poorly correlates with volume status. Recently, stroke volume variation has been recognized as a good parameter to predict volume status and fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing liver resection. However, no previous publications have studied the efficacy of stroke volume variation monitoring compared with central venous pressure monitoring to reduce perioperative blood loss during open liver resection.

The study aimed to compare the efficacy of maintaining high stroke volume variation versus low central venous pressure in reducing perioperative blood loss during the liver transection phase in open liver resection.",NO,"Liver Tumor; Surgery|Primary Liver Tumor, Metastatic Liver|Primary Liver Cancer|Liver Resection|Benign Liver Tumor",DEVICE: High stroke volume variation group,"Intraoperative blood loss during parenchymal transection phase and entire operation, To compare intraoperative blood loss between patients maintained with high stroke volume variation and those maintained with low central venous pressure during open liver resection by assessing:

One challenge of finding a clinical trial, is the lack of clinical trials at the patient's home cancer centre. The Clinical Trials Navigator (CTN) program was established to help patients, their families and heath care providers navigate the clinical trials systems across Canada in order to identify meaningful clinical trials for patients and help them enter those trials.

The CTN program was piloted in Windsor, Ontario and increased clinical trials accrual for this population by 8%. This study plans to roll out to twenty centres across Canada, mimicing the process. This implementation of the CTN program will be tested by adding centres in a sequential fashion until all centres are added over the 12 month period.

The objectives are improved patient enrollment which will be measured by embedded CTNs in each cancer centre, and reporting to the central site.

The professional must therefore consider the challenges and limitations of effective communication.

The dental hygienist is a healthcare professional who plays a crucial role in the prevention and promotion of oral health. These specialists assist and educate patients on oral hygiene practices. In order to communicate effectively, especially in today's modern society, it is essential to use increasingly advanced communication tools. The hygienist's task is to explore new technologies and communication methods to motivate patients.

Through empathetic, respectful, and personalized communication, a lasting relationship is often established between the hygienist and the patient. This is because their interactions are generally more frequent than those between the patient and the dentist. While professional oral hygiene sessions are recommended at least once a year for everyone, ""fragile"" patients-those with periodontal disease or other conditions-may require more frequent visits.

In everyday practice, it has been observed that patients tend to feel more comfortable discussing their doubts, concerns, and issues with dental hygienists rather than with dentists.

NCT06904937,Renal Manifestations During Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06904937,IIM,RECRUITING,"There are currently no recommendations regarding treatments for Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIM) due to the difficulty in conducting high-powered randomized controlled trials.

Generally speaking, corticosteroids constitute one of the cornerstones of treatment and are, with some exceptions, always used at least in the initial phase of the disease. In general, this involves oral corticosteroid therapy initiated between 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg/day followed by a gradual decrease after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment. It is generally necessary to introduce immunosuppressive treatment early with the aim of avoiding corticosteroids. The most commonly used as first-line treatment and having shown effectiveness in observational studies are methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and calcineurin inhibitors. In general, rituximab is reserved for severe forms refractory to several first-line immunosuppressants, and has shown some effectiveness during a randomized study. Likewise, cyclophosphamide is only considered in the most severe forms, generally rapidly progressive interstitial lung damage. More recently, Janus kinase inhibitors have been evaluated in several open-label and small-number studies, showing interesting effectiveness, particularly for refractory forms, as shown in this recent review of the literature. Immunoglobulins are the only treatment that has shown superiority compared to placebo in good quality randomized controlled studies. However, due to their cost and difficulty of access, they should be reserved for the severe form, particularly in cases of dysphagia, or refractory form.

Apart from these medicinal treatments, it is necessary to add all the non-drug measures which are an integral part of the management of IIM. Performing regular physical activity helps prevent muscle loss and also has a beneficial effect on other comorbidities often present in patients and aggravated by corticosteroid therapy, such as cardiovascular risk factors, osteoporosis and resistance to 'insulin.",NO,Inflammatory Myopathy,,"Describe the characteristics of patients with inflammatory myopathies, Up to 1 year",,,"University Hospital, Strasbourg, France",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,15,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,9136,2024-01-05,2025-12,2025-12-05,2025-04-01,,2025-04-01,"Service de Rhumatologie - CHU de Strasbourg - France, Strasbourg, 67091, France",

In special circumstances, such as prematurity or illness, breast milk is not always available, and donor human milk (DHM) is an option. Some studies have reported growth retardation in babies fed DHM, probably due to the less adequate nutritional composition. There are several factors that contribute to changes in its nutritional composition. Among the various factors, the following are worth highlighting: wide variety of donors with different characteristics (e.g. gestational age, lactation phase, diet); inconsistency of the collection method; impact of milk processing, i.e. the pasteurization process.

Coordinated by Prof. Dr. Christophe De Block at Universitair Ziekenhuis Antwerpen (UZA), Belgium, and sponsored by Changsha Sinocare Inc., the study aims to assess changes in glucometric parameters over 60 days. The primary objective is to demonstrate an improvement in Time in Range (TIR) compared to baseline, measured during an initial 15-day blinded period using self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) assessed by the iCan O3 CGM System. Secondary objectives include evaluating the system's efficacy, safety, and usability, as well as patient-reported outcomes such as treatment satisfaction and diabetes management impact. The study will enroll 70 patients aged 18-75 with HbA1c \>7.5%, stable treatment regimens, and smartphone proficiency while excluding individuals with recent diabetes-related hospitalizations, severe comorbidities, or conflicting trial participation.

NCT06904833,Gauging Outcomes of Locomotion Formats,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06904833,GOLF,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Investigators intend to use Actiheart® Monitors with a cohort of 16-30 elite amateur golfers over 18 (male and female) from Tournament Golf to clarify golfer's energy expenditure across a round of 18 holes in each condition at a championship course in Portugal.

In a randomised repeated measures design, participants will either walk or use a buggy for 18 holes. All sets of clubs will be placed in the buggy at all times. Baseline measures (e.g., weight, height, performance metrics, age will also be recorded). Each group will be assigned a helper/ coach to ensure only the correct participants are using the buggies. The buggy will be driven by a member of staff to ensure the buggy is moving at a controlled speed and only travelling to the necessary places on the golf course. Rounds will be timed from start to finish. Elements will be controlled throughout the week by the nutritionist on site. This includes practice sessions (e.g., driving range, chipping), gym sessions and the competitors will be playing under tournament conditions. Global positioning system (GPS) and step count will also be monitored.

Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) will also be measured using the modified Borg Scale . This will be collected pre round, during every 6 holes (holes 6, 12 and 18) and post round. Trackman (Trackman 4) machinery will also be set up every 6 holes (6, 12, 18), to measure performance variables (e.g., driving distance/ accuracy) at various points during the round to determine if there is a possible difference in performance when using a different method of transport. Players will not be told what these devices are measuring to ensure it doesn't affect mindset. Upgame will also be used to measure performance statistics and individuals scoring to determine if there is any correlation between this and energy expended. Force plates (Smart2move 1D) will also be used to measure ground reaction forces pre and post round by a strength and conditioning coach.

The principal investigator will transport the Actiheart ® monitors to Portugal. Prior to each round of 18 holes, participants will be fitted with an Actiheart® accelerometer (Actiheart®; dimensions: 39.7 × 30.3 ×9.25 mm; weight: 10.5 g) and chest heart rate monitor (Camn tech, Fenstanton, UK). Participant HR and activity levels will be recorded using 15 second epochs to estimate AEE for the duration of each activity and round of competitive golf. The data will be downloaded from the device immediately following each round and activity for analysis. The lead investigator will collect the data and then it will be analysed to establish the activity energy expenditure during a round of golf when walking or using a buggy.

Cognitive function measurements will also be assessed by a simplified version of VAS- Fatigue. We will use two visual rating scales (none to worst imaginable) pre and post round to measure cognitive fatigue and physical fatigue. A Stroop test will also be used to assess selective attention, inhibition and cognitive flexibility pre and post round. Players post round will be asked a 10-15 open ended questionnaire to assess their feelings towards using a buggy. Questions will include, 'did you think using the buggy today enhanced your performance?' and vice versa. The NASA- TLX. This measures mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort and frustration.

Differential RPE (d-RPE) will be asked of players post 18 holes which will allow us to quantify a perceived load for different subscales such as breathing, limb, cognitive/ technical and overall. Core temperature will be assessed using telemetry pills. Participants will swallow the pill at least one hour before we start getting a measure to ensure it has been digested. A reader will be used post round and held next to the participants stomach that will download all the relevant information. Data will be collected every 10 minutes for 60 minutes. To maximise the study's internal validity, all participants will be amateur golfers currently registered as students as the Tournament Golf College. The data will be collected and stored onto a secure LJMU drive, this will be pseudo- anonymised.

It is hoped that the result of this study will clarify energy expenditure of elite amateur male and female golfers whilst using a buggy or walking throughout a tournament week.

The rationale for this study is grounded in three key factors: Firstly, Zambia faces significant health challenges due to zoonotic diseases, which account for a considerable proportion of public health threats. This study aims to gather insights into the knowledge and practices of various system actors regarding food safety, animal disease surveillance, animal medicines controls, and one health systems regulation to provide critical data that will inform targeted interventions and policies. This research aligns with programmed activities under Zambia's National One Health Strategy 2022-2026.

Secondly, the agricultural sector, which is a cornerstone of Zambia's rural economy, heavily relies on healthy livestock and sustainable farming practices. The study will gather insights on the practices of food producers, traders, and markets, essential for the identification of potential areas of improvement and innovation. This is particularly crucial as the agricultural sector supports the livelihoods of a large portion of the population and plays a vital role in food security.

Thirdly, the One Health approach emphasises the importance of collaboration between various sectors and disciplines.

Protocol-based MSU can detect pathologic changes including cartilage swelling, fragmentation of the tibial tubercle ossification center, patellar tendon lesions, and reactive bursitis of the deep or superficial tibial patellar bursae and is increasingly used by physical therapists in the diagnostic process.

It is hypothesized that the validity of the physical examination is insufficient to accurately classify different conditions in AKP in patients aged 7-50 years. Therefore the use of MSU as an add-on is essential.

NCT06904326,UBE Stability / Dynamic Radio,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06904326,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Degenerative pathologies of the spine affect a large proportion of the increasingly ageing population, and are a major public health issue. When conservative treatments (physiotherapy, analgesics, infiltrations) fail, surgical treatment is preferred.

Traditionally, a simple lumbar recalibration operation is preferred (bilateral laminectomy decompression), but this may affect spinal stability. In cases of spondylolisthesis or preoperative instability, lumbar fusion (arthrodesis) is sometimes necessary to avoid the risk of major instability, but such an operation is not without risk and may require repeat surgery.

The development of new surgical techniques such as uni or bilateral laminotomies, which are less radical, has made it possible to avoid some arthrodeses. Nowadays, the emergence of new surgical techniques such as endoscopy has further reduced the risk of destabilization (shorter post-operative convalescence, less atrophy of the paraspinal muscles) and improved surgeon comfort (better vision and easier instrument handling).

Unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) is one of two endoscopic techniques and has proven its effectiveness for lumbar decompression in terms of clinical benefits. However, there is no scientific evidence on spinal stability after recalibration under UBE.

We believe that minimizing invasiveness with UBE during simple lumbar recalibration surgery can preserve spinal stability, thereby reducing the need for lumbar fixation and lowering the cost of care.

We therefore propose to study the maintenance of spinal stability using dynamic radiography at 3 months post-operatively in patients undergoing lumbar recalibration surgery with UBE.",NO,Spinal Instability,OTHER: Postoperative dynamic radiography,"Spinal stability rate, absence of abnormal vertebral mobility, 3 months","Spondylolisthesis rate, 3 months|Perioperative complications rate, 1 day|Oswestry Disability index evaluation, measure of patient incapacity improvement after surgery, 3 months|Pain evaluation, measure of lumbar and radicular pain improvement after surgery with visual analog scale, 3 months|Vertebral mobility evaluation, change in vertebral mobility between preoperative and postoperative dynamic radiography, 3 months",,"Clinique Saint Jean, France",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,400,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,2025-A00134-45,2025-04,2027-07,2027-07,2025-04-01,,2025-04-01,,

NCT06904274,A Study to Learn How Well Mirena Works as Compared to Oral Progestin in Nonatypical Endometrial Hyperplasia in Women Who Have Started Their Periods,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06904274,SUNFLOWER,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Researchers are looking for a better way to treat women with nonatypical endometrial hyperplasia (NAEH).

Endometrial hyperplasia is a condition where the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) becomes too thick. Nonatypical means that the condition is not cancerous. It is often caused by hormone imbalances in women. Symptoms can include abnormal vaginal bleeding or irregular periods. If this condition is not treated, then it may lead to cancer.

Currently, oral progestins (OP) which are progesterone (female hormone) capsules taken by mouth, are used to treat NAEH. However, there is still a need for other treatments due to unmet needs.

The study treatment, Mirena (also known as BAY 865028), is already available as a type of birth control device. It is inserted into the uterus where it gradually releases progesterone.

In this study, researchers want to find out if Mirena works for women with NAEH. They believe it can help by keeping hormone levels balanced in the body.

The main purpose of this study is to learn how well Mirena works compared to oral in NAEH in women who have started their periods.

For this, the researchers will compare the number of participants with benign endometrium after 6 months of treatment with Mirena or oral progestins.

The study participants will be randomly divided equally into one of two treatment groups. Based on their group, participants will receive Mirena, which is inserted into the uterus at the start of the study, or they will take progestins once daily by mouth for 6 months.

Each participant will be in the study for around 10 months with up to 5 visits to the study clinic/site.

Participants will visit the study clinic:

* once before the treatment starts
* 3 times with a gap of 3 months between the visits during the treatment
* then 1 more time after the treatment ends

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

* check participant's health by performing tests such as blood and urine tests
* perform vaginal ultrasound and hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy is a minor surgical procedure where a thin camera will be inserted into the womb to check for any abnormality. Sampling of the endometrial lining (cells in the womb) will be done with a thin tube at the same time.
* take samples of womb (endometrial) lining
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having

Each domain has 3 response categories: no problems, some problems and a lot of problems. The response categories can be reflected by a 1-digit number (1-3) and combined for the five dimensions into a 5-digit number to describe the health state of the patient. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical VAS of 0-100 where 100=""The best health you can imagine"" and 0=""The worst health you can imagine"".

Oxaliplatin induce immunogenic cell death, and gemcitabin deplete regulatory immune cells. The GEMOX regimen thus has the potential for a synergic effect with immunotherapy in HCC.

NCT06904079,Prediction and Intervention Effect of Rehabilitation Status for Severe Mental Disorder Patients Based on Multimodal Analysis and AI Agents,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06904079,,RECRUITING,"Mental health issues represent a major public health and social problem that significantly impacts economic and social development. Compared to other diseases, mental disorders can impair various aspects of a patient' s life, including psychological, social, occupational, and educational functions, affecting their quality of life and daily living abilities. Particularly, severe mental disorders tend to have a chronic course, often resulting in diminished social functions and social withdrawal, making it difficult for patients to integrate into society. Repeated, systematic, and comprehensive rehabilitation training for patients with severe mental disorders can effectively control or delay disease recurrence, improve social functions, enhance quality of life, and facilitate patients' reintegration into society.

In recent years, the scope of mental disorder rehabilitation has expanded to include enhancing patients' social functions and promoting their integration into society. Vocational rehabilitation and social skills training are widely used in the rehabilitation treatment of patients with severe mental disorders, and some physical intervention methods, such as neurofeedback training, have also proven to be significantly effective in the rehabilitation process. However, traditional rehabilitation techniques often lack specificity and fail to meet individualized needs of patients. Additionally, the rehabilitation process lacks long-term monitoring, making it challenging to continuously assess and adjust patients' rehabilitation outcomes. Furthermore, the assessment of rehabilitation effectiveness mainly relies on patients' subjective feelings and clinical observations, lacking high-quality evidence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to introduce new rehabilitation technologies and scientifically evaluate their effectiveness to address the shortcomings of traditional methods and provide more personalized, precise, and effective rehabilitation support.

With the rise of digital health technologies, the field of mental health rehabilitation has encountered new opportunities. Compared to traditional therapies, digital health is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, moving away from traditional approaches to healthcare management to real-time personalized monitoring and therapeutic care.Technologies such as remote monitoring, virtual reality, and computer-assisted cognitive correction therapy are increasingly applied in rehabilitation. However, these methods still need improvements in data management and integration capabilities. A large amount of data accumulates in systems, recording only the training process and real-time effects of patients, without further evaluating their rehabilitation status, leading to resource waste. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a digital rehabilitation model that better meets the genuine needs of patients with severe mental disorders.

Blood cancers (such as leukemias) can be hard to treat, especially if they have mutations in the TP53 or RAS genes. These mutations can cause the cancer cells to create substances called neoepitopes. Researchers want to test a method of treating blood cancers by altering a person s T cells (a type of immune cell) to target neoepitopes.

Objective:

To test the use of neoepitope-specific T cells in people with blood cancers

Eligibility:

People aged 18 to 75 years with any of 9 blood cancers.

Design:

Participants will have a bone marrow biopsy: A sample of soft tissue will be removed from inside a pelvic bone. This is needed to confirm their diagnosis and the TP53 and RAS mutations in their cancer cells. They will also have a skin biopsy to look for these mutations in other tissue.

Participants will undergo apheresis: Blood will be taken from their body through a vein. The blood will pass through a machine that separates out the T cells. The remaining blood will be returned to the body through a different vein.

The T cells will be grown to become neoepitope-specific T cells.

NCT06903910,Investigating the Cholinergic Contribution to Gait Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06903910,,RECRUITING,"People with Parkinson's disease often experience problems with 'gait' and balance. Gait refers to the way a person moves while walking, such as their speed and length of steps. People with Parkinson's may experience slowness of movement, shuffle their feet, or have periods of 'freezing', during which their feet feel like they are stuck to the floor. Some people may struggle to maintain their balance and fall. These symptoms are frequently disabling and can lead to a worse quality of life. The nervous system is your body's messaging system - it helps different parts of your body communicate with one another. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that deliver those messages from one part of the body to another. The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of ARICEPT (Donepezil hydrochloride) improves gait and balance and its relation to the size of an area of the brain called ""Cholinergic Nucleus 4"" (Ch4). The study team is also studying how degeneration (breakdown and eventual loss) in Ch4 contributes to problems with gait and balance. One way this may happen is through the loss of a chemical in the brain called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter and its activity is associated with alertness, thinking, and the ability to move. Taking a drug that increases acetylcholine, such as ARICEPT, may improve gait and balance. By better understanding this relationship, we may be able to improve the treatment of gait and balance problems in the future.",NO,Parkinson Disease,DRUG: Donepezil (Aricept),"Relationship between Ch4 GMD and gait speed, We hypothesize that lower baseline Ch4 GMD will be associated with slower baseline gait speed, Baseline","Relationship between baseline Ch4 GMD and gait response to donepezil, We hypothesize that we will be able to see improvement in gait speed (and potentially other gait metrics) following 12 weeks of donepezil administration, at least in some patients.

The significant clinical and pathological complete response rates offer the possibility of avoiding surgical resection. dMMR colorectal cancers are generally larger and more advanced than pMMR tumors, often requiring more extensive surgery with associated risks such as anastomotic leakage, ureteral injury, and infection. If oncological outcomes are not affected (requiring long-term follow-up), non-surgical treatment becomes an attractive option for localized dMMR colorectal cancer. Moreover, pelvic radiotherapy, the standard for locally advanced rectal cancer, causes both short-term and long-term adverse effects (e.g., bowel and bladder dysfunction, fistula, infertility), significantly impacting quality of life. Total mesorectal excision also carries risks of complications and sexual dysfunction, often requiring a stoma, making organ preservation a more urgent need for rectal cancer patients.

NCT06903780,Experience of Biologic Treatments for Severe Asthma: a Survey,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06903780,SHARP EoB,RECRUITING,"Severe asthma is a disease characterised by respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms. The respiratory symptoms can include breathlessness, wheeze and asthma attacks. The disease can come to dominate patients' lives, impacting their social, working and personal lives, leading to depression, anxiety and feelings of social isolation.

There are now 7 different biologic treatments available on the NHS in the UK for severe asthma. These treatments have dramatically changed how severe asthma can be treated. Research has typically focused on the benefits of these drugs from a clinical perspective, e.g., improvements in lung function, blood tests and reduction in frequency of asthma attacks and use of steroid tablets.

While these are important outcomes, they do not reflect the experiences of patients receiving these treatments, which can vary greatly. First, not all patients benefit to the same degree. Second for patients who do respond, some respond slower than others. Third while these treatments target respiratory symptoms, some patients report wider benefits, such as reductions in fatigue, depression, ability to engage in family life and other daily activities. Fourth, patients report different side effects when starting these treatments and sometimes for months afterwards, including headaches, fatigue, mental fog and joint pain. These experiences are reported by clinicians and patients, but the extent of these four variations is poorly understood, and potential reasons for them have not been explored.

To describe these differences between patients' experiences and begin understanding why they are present, we have co-designed a survey with people who have lived experience of severe asthma who are members of the European Lung Foundation's (ELF) Patient Advisory Group (PAG).

NCT06903624,Cannabis in Postoperative Pain Management,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06903624,Cannabis,COMPLETED,"Postoperative pain management is critical for surgical recovery, affecting patient outcomes, hospitalization duration, and quality of life. Variability in pain perception and medication needs among surgical patients poses a challenge in clinical practice. Identifying predictive factors for pain severity and analgesic use could enhance personalized pain management strategies.

Cannabis, containing cannabinoids with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, has garnered attention as a potential pain management option for surgical patients. The effectiveness of cannabis varies, depending on surgery type, severity, and individual pain tolerance. Some studies suggest cannabis users may experience heightened pain sensitivity and require more analgesics, while others highlight its potential to reduce opioid use. Despite growing interest, the use of cannabis in surgery remains controversial due to a lack of large-scale clinical trials evaluating its safety and efficacy in this setting.

Some research indicates cannabis use could lower pain levels post-surgery and reduce opioid needs. However, other studies raise safety concerns, and conflicting findings have yet to establish its role conclusively. Given these uncertainties, healthcare professionals must carefully monitor cannabis use in surgical patients. Patients should inform providers of any cannabis use before surgery to ensure appropriate pain management and minimize risks.

This study aims to analyze pain intensity and analgesic usage patterns across various surgeries using real-world medical data.

NCT06903299,Prospective Investigation of Intra-Articular Tranexamic Acid Use in Elective Hip Arthroplasty,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06903299,,RECRUITING,"Tranexamic acid (trans-4-aminomethyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid) is an antifibrinolytic substance that chemically belongs to the group of e-carboxylic acids. TXA is a synthetic amino acid derivative of lysine that competitively inhibits the activation of plasminogen to the serine protease, plasmin. TXA is a competitive inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator, blocking the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen, resulting in inhibition of plasminogen activation and fibrin binding to plasminogen and therefore impairment of fibrinolysis.

Due to its antifibrinolytic effect (reduction of bleeding), TXA has been recently an increasing interest in orthopaedics, especially in elective major joint replacements.

The total hip arthroplasties (ΤΗΑ) are associated with perioperative blood losses exceeding 500 mL. Blood loss volumes are dependent on the chosen surgical approach and technique. Some patients that undergo elective hip replacement receive at least one blood unit in postoperative care. Heterotopic ossification is also a common complication after THA, presented as bone in soft tissue where bone normally does not appear. TXA reduces postoperative blood losses and consequently leads to less frequent blood transfusions. This has an impact on the economic burden for the health care system. Increased blood loss could lead to longer length of stay at the hospital and the connected economic consequences. TXA further reduces the incidence of heterotopic ossification after elective THA.

Virtual reality is defined as an artificial 3D visual environment and AR, as virtual objects superimposed on the real world; mixed reality (MIXREAL) is the association between VR and AR.

The first clinical experience using AR in a PN was in 2008, and since then, clinical trials of 3D assisted minimally invasive PN have been developed, such as the first trial evaluating both AR and VR in videolaparoscopic PN, a prospective cohort, and the first randomized clinical trial evaluating 3D model in robot assisted PN (RAPN), but using only VR; posteriorly, Porpiglia et al. and Li et al. published clinical trials of RAPN using AR.

While rarely symptomatic, they often cause emotional distress due to the unappealing appearance of the mass. Treatment of unsightly lipomas is excision with local anesthetic in the office or with sedation in the operating room. The recovery period is short and the procedure is low risk; however, the result of the operation is a visible scar over the site of the lipoma. Many patients defer surgical excision because excision of a lipoma is a cosmetic procedure, but the aesthetic outcome is undesirable.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a technique that applies heat generated by a high frequency, alternating current to soft tissue. The hyperthermia produced by the current causes tissue necrosis that ablates the tissue into which the energy is directed. RFA has been successfully applied to thyroid nodules, pancreatic lesions, esophageal dysplasia and liver tumors.

Specific aims:

1. Explore implementation factors of the SBIRT program within HIV prevention and treatment services through a process evaluation. We will quantitatively track the number of AYA in the SBIRT care cascade: 1) the number screened who have recent alcohol use; 2) the number of those with recent alcohol use who receive the brief intervention (BI); 3) the number of those who are referred for additional treatment; and 4) among those who are referred, the number who successfully link and complete treatment. We will collect time use data from clinic staff and counselors to estimate the time burden required for the SBIRT program. We will conduct 30 in-depth interviews with AYA three months after the screening. The sample will include adolescents who: (1) did not recently use alcohol; (2) received BI due to recent alcohol use that was low/moderate risk; and (3) were referred for treatment due to higher risk alcohol use. Interviews will focus on: (1) implementation factors (e.g., acceptability, feasibility) of the SBIRT program and (2) barriers and facilitators to the program's implementation. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews will also be conducted with program staff (e.g., counselors, clinic staff) and other stakeholders (e.g., community leaders, policy-makers).

Most patients with NSCLC are at the advanced stage of diagnosis and have a poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate of stage III patients is about 15%, the 5-year survival rate of stage IV patients is less than 5%, and the median survival time is only 7 months.

CEACAM5 (CEA), also known as CD66e, is a classic tumor marker that has been used as a marker for many types of tumors for 50 years. It is mainly expressed in lung cancer, esophageal cancer, bile duct cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and other tumor types.

Neores Study - Evaluating Systemic Chemotherapy Efficacy in Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases

Principal Investigator:

Peter Cashin Akademiska sjukhuset / Uppsala universitet

Background:

Peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer are often associated with poorer outcomes compared to other metastatic sites. While systemic chemotherapy is widely used as a neoadjuvant treatment prior to CRS (Cytoreductive Surgery) and HIPEC (Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy), its efficacy specifically for peritoneal metastases remains underexplored. Current practice in many countries includes neoadjuvant therapy to evaluate tumor biology and attempt tumor downstaging before surgery, despite the lack of robust data supporting this approach in colorectal cancer.

Purpose and Aims:

The study aims to evaluate how effective systemic chemotherapy is in treating isolated peritoneal metastases in colorectal cancer patients. The protocol defines two specific populations:

Patients receiving upfront systemic conversion chemotherapy. Patients undergoing open/close laparotomy (non-resectable disease found during surgery).

Key Research Questions:

What is the response rate to systemic chemotherapy before surgery? How many patients progress to CRS+HIPEC? What is the prognosis of those not undergoing surgery? How effective is FMCA (Fluorometric Microculture Cytotoxicity Assay) in predicting chemotherapy sensitivity? Do patients treated with FMCA-guided sensitive chemotherapy have better outcomes?

Methods:

This is a retrospective chart review study based on patient data from 2004-2021. It includes:

Review of HIPEC MDT (multidisciplinary team) conference notes to identify patients recommended for neoadjuvant conversion therapy.

Review of open/close laparotomy cases with FMCA testing.

Inclusion Criteria:

For HIPEC Pathway:

Colorectal cancer with isolated peritoneal metastases. Patients recommended for systemic chemotherapy before CRS+HIPEC.

For Open/Close Pathway:

Isolated peritoneal metastases discovered during surgery. Successful FMCA analysis performed.

Updated Inclusion (2024):

Patients with simultaneously resectable liver, para-aortal, and lung metastases are now allowed.

Exclusion Criteria (both pathways):

Appendiceal cancer. Retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. Other systemic metastases (liver, lung, brain, bone, etc.), unless resectable under updated criteria.

Data Collection:

Patient data will be retrieved from:

Uppsala University Hospital records Nationella Patientöversikten (national electronic health record) Swedish patient registry Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR) (especially for molecular markers like KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, MMR) When data is incomplete, referral hospitals will be contacted to gather additional information on administered chemotherapy (first and second-line therapies), therapy response, and survival outcomes.

Endpoints:

For chemotherapy group: Response to therapy and conversion to CRS+HIPEC. For open/close group: Progression-free survival and overall survival. Evaluation of FMCA sensitivity prediction accuracy. Outcomes based on whether patients received FMCA-indicated sensitive or resistant chemotherapy.

Statistical Methods:

Descriptive statistics. Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox proportional hazards models.

Clinical Significance:

There is a clear lack of high-quality evidence evaluating systemic chemotherapy's role in isolated peritoneal metastases. Despite being widely used, neoadjuvant therapy may not significantly improve survival outcomes in these cases, as seen in analogous ovarian cancer settings. The Neores study seeks to clarify the real-world effectiveness of this approach and to evaluate whether FMCA-guided treatment has clinical utility in predicting treatment success.

Given the uniqueness of Uppsala's long-standing use of FMCA, the study could provide important insights for patient selection and personalized therapy decisions.",NO,Colorectal Cancer Metastatic|Peritoneal Metastases from Colorectal Cancer,,"Overall survival, 24 months after treatment","Objective response rate, 3 to 6 months",,Uppsala University,Uppsala University Hospital,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,185,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,NEORES,2019-03-21,2024-11-12,2025-03-21,2025-03-30,,2025-03-30,"Akademiska Sjukhuset (Uppsala University hospital), Uppsala, 75185, Sweden",

The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD.

Interpretation of the PCL-5 should be made by a clinician. The PCL-5 can be scored in different ways:

A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items.

DSM-5 symptom cluster severity scores can be obtained by summing the scores for the items within a given cluster, i.e., cluster B (items 1-5), cluster C (items 6-7), cluster D (items 8-14), and cluster E (items 15-20).

A provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made by treating each item rated as 2 = ""Moderately"" or higher as a symptom endorsed, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic rule which requires at least: 1 B item (questions 1-5), 1 C item (questions 6-7), 2 D items (questions 8-14), 2 E items (questions 15-20)., From Baseline to End of Study (approx. 8 weeks from baseline)|To assess the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy on symptoms of PTSD in adult participants with PTSD secondary to sexual assault, Change in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a commonly used measure of trait and state anxiety (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, \& Jacobs, 1983). It can be used in clinical settings to diagnose anxiety and to distinguish it from depressive syndromes. It also is often used in research as an indicator of caregiver distress (e.g., Greene et al., 2017, Ugalde et al., 2014).

Form Y, its most popular version, has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. State anxiety items include: ""I am tense; I am worried"" and ""I feel calm; I feel secure."" Trait anxiety items include: ""I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter"" and ""I am content; I am a steady person.""

TR causes decreased forward cardiac output and increased intravascular pressure upstream, which lead to peripheral oedema, ascites, hepatic congestion and kidney failure.

The microbiota is also getting increasing attention and changes in microbiota have been already associated with cardiovascular disease.

The impact of hemodynamic effects of TR on the gut microbiota however is still unknown.

Patients affected by TR frequently complain abdominal distension and anorexia. We hypothesize that, due to increased venous congestion, TR may induce impaired gut function with modification in the microbiota and that TR correction may induce reverse changes.

This study will enroll patients treated with Transcatheter Tricuspid Edge-to-Edge Repair (T-TEER) at the Valve Center of San Raffaele Hospital due to severe TR.

In addition to the standard of care, before T-TEER, for all patients 2 additional blood samples, 1 urine and 1 fecal sample will be collected.

3 months after the procedure, all patients will be re-assessed at the Valve Center outpatient clinic as standard of care.

NCT06902883,Study on the Effectiveness and Comfort of Innovative Solutions for the Internal Transport of Patients in Wheelchairs in a Hospital Setting,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06902883,PreDoPTI,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In 2006, 2012, and 2018, under the auspices of the Pain Control Committee, Gustave Roussy stretcher-bearers conducted studies on patient pain caused by internal transport (stretchers). The first study showed that this pain is primarily experienced by patients initially in pain, and that risk factors include crossing elevator landings and threshold bars, handling, and prolonged waiting times.

A progress plan was developed, and since 2006, improvement initiatives have been regularly implemented. Their effectiveness has been evaluated by patients and the professionals involved (departure department, carrier, and arrival department).

Stretcher-bearing software was purchased following the original study; scheduling has been streamlined, journeys are transmitted to stretcher-bearers via smartphones, and transport times are calculated and analyzed. In 2019, a prototype for connecting patients' IV poles to wheelchairs was developed and tested, thanks to a collaboration between technical services, stretcher-bearers, and the Bureau of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. The time spent by stretcher-bearers transferring infusion sets and other syringe pumps from the patient's IV pole to the wheelchair's pole on the way out, and vice versa on the way back to the room, has been eliminated. The hypothesis is that this elimination would reduce travel times and could have an indirect impact on reducing pain.

Wheelchair comfort has been continually improved since 2006: the front casters were replaced with softer and thicker ones, the rear wheels with soft wheels and then with pneumatic tires; the backrests were replaced with a memory foam model, and the seats with an ""ultra-comfort"" model. These improvements contribute to better pain management during transport and an improved patient experience. Wheelchair comfort could be further improved by replacing the seats with high-quality ""Bultex"" models.

In 2022, 33,800 patients were transported in wheelchairs (round trip, one-way or one-way), representing 35% of annual transports. Technical developments and improvements in wheelchair comfort could contribute to reducing pain caused by internal transport.

Primary Objective To evaluate the effect of two interventions (a system for connecting the IV pole to the wheelchair and a new seat) during the internal transport of cancer patients being treated at Gustave Roussy:

Intervention 1: To evaluate the impact of using the IV pole connection system on reducing the duration of wheelchair transport for patients receiving infusions; Intervention 2: To evaluate patient preference for the comfort of a wheelchair seat.

We aim to evaluate the benefits of this collaboration for adult patients admitted to the internal medicine ward of a regional hospital who are taking seven or more drugs and are being discharged to home.

NCT06902753,Adaptation and Normalization of a Verbal Episodic Memory Test in French Sign Language,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06902753,RL-RI-LSF,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"To date, neuropsychological assessment of deaf signing persons is complicated by a lack of resources, especially the absence of tools available in French Sign Language (LSF). This is due to perceptual and cultural differences, and in particular the linguistic differences between French and LSF.

This lack of resources significantly hinders access to care for deaf patients, as neuropsychological assessment is often a key clinical criterion in the diagnosis of certain neurological pathologies (Alzheimer's disease in particular) and enables coherent care plans to be drawn up, for example in the aftermath of strokes or traumatic brain injuries.

In particular, episodic memory (which refers to the ability to memorise information anchored in a specific context) is a cognitive domain that is sensitive to pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, but it is not currently possible to assess it with deaf signing patients.

The aim of this study is to create a memory assessment test adapted to a deaf population that expresses in LSF and to normalize this test on this same population.

The aim is to provide a diagnosis assessment tool, which currently does not exist in France, to improve access to care for deaf people. This project could then be extended to the creation of tests for other cognitive domains (executive functions, attention, social cognition, etc.) and to prospects for cognitive remediation.

The 16-item Free and Cued Recall test (RL-RI 16) is the best choice because it is easy to use and accurate enough to assess each stage of episodic memory. These qualities make it a decisive tool in certain differential diagnosis.

In order to select the most relevant signs, lexical lists by frequency in LSF will be drawn up during a preliminary phase, during which the participants will have to give, in one minute, the maximum number of signs belonging to different categories (animals, vegetables, clothes...). These lists will be used to select the most relevant signs according to their frequency (neither too common nor too rare), based on the same principle as RL-RI 16.

It will then be standardised on deaf adults, for whom LSF is the main language, with no cognitive impairment, across France, via the various Deaf Care Units, with the help of French / LSF interpreters. Working with different centers in France will make it possible to recruit a larger and more representative number of participants, and to be more sensitive to any regional effects.",NO,Neuropsychological Tests|Memory|Alzheimer Disease|Deafness|Sign Language|Cognitive Impairment,OTHER: Questionnaire and Physical Exam,"Normed data for the RL-RI-LSF test for a deaf population without cognitive impairment, The main goal of this study is to propose normed data for the RL-RI-LSF test (adaptation in LSF of the RL-RI 16 test) for a deaf population without cognitive impairment.

These treatments reduce male hormone levels to slow cancer growth.

More recently, a new class of drugs called Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors (ARSIs) has been introduced. These drugs are used alongside standard hormone therapy and are now given to both advanced and high-risk localized prostate cancer patients.

There are two main types of ARSIs: abiraterone acetate, which blocks androgen production, and enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide, which prevent cancer cells from using androgens. Doctors choose between these treatments based on patient needs, as no single drug has been proven superior. These therapies have significantly improved patient survival.

However, studies show that 30% of prostate cancer patients die from heart-related problems, a higher rate than in the general population. It is important to understand the link between these treatments and heart risks.

One study found that all ARSIs increase the risk of serious heart issues. However, it did not consider patients' previous heart conditions, which are known to affect heart risk with abiraterone and enzalutamide.

NCT06902389,A Clinical Study of Multi-target Hi-TCR-T Cells in the Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06902389,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This study is a prospective, single-arm, open, single-center clinical trial initiated by the investigator. The principal investigators are professors Shen Feng and Zhang Xiaofeng from The Third Affiliated Hospital of Navy Military Medical University (Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital).

Primary Objectives:

1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of super Hi-TCR-T cells targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP in the treatment of refractory/recurrent advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid tumors.
2. To assess the efficacy of super Hi-TCR-T cells targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP in the treatment of refractory/recurrent advanced HCC and other solid tumors, focusing on progression-free survival (PFS).

Secondary Objectives:

1. To evaluate the efficacy of super Hi-TCR-T cells targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP in the treatment of refractory/recurrent advanced HCC and other solid tumors at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, assessing disease control rate (DCR: CR+PR+SD), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).
2. To observe and assess the quality of life (QOL score) of patients receiving super Hi-TCR-T cell therapy targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP for refractory/recurrent advanced HCC and other solid tumors.

Exploratory Objectives:

1. To evaluate the relationship between the in vivo expansion and persistence of super Hi-TCR-T cells targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP and disease progression.
2. To explore potential predictive biomarkers. Thirty patients are planned to be recruited for this study. The subjects were advanced HCC patients who had failed second-line therapy or could not tolerate therapy. The expression levels of Nectin4, NKG2DL, TROP2, B7H3, GPC3 and FAP were detected by immunohistochemistry in the pathologic tissues of the primary and metastatic sites. Meanwhile, 20ml peripheral blood was extracted to evaluate the quality of T cells (in vitro proliferation activity and lentiviral transduction efficiency). Patients with positive expression rates of at least 2 targets (excluding FAP) \>10% and qualified T cell quality could be considered for inclusion.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected and Hi-TCR-T cells targeting three targets (including FAP) were prepared. After pretreatment with fludarabine + cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (FC regimen), the prepared Hi-TCR-T cells were transfused back, in which the dose of Hi-TCR-T cells at each target was 3.0x106 cells/kg body weight (the dose was the extended therapeutic dose obtained in the previous clinical trial), and the drug was administered by peripheral intravenous infusion. To improve efficacy, Hi-TCR-T cell retransfusion can be prepared by increasing the cell dose of the target or changing the combination of the target as the disease progresses and evaluated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT).

Safety and efficacy evaluation and exploratory studies were conducted after reinfusion of Hi-TCR-T cells from screening multiple targets:

1. Safety assessment: at baseline, 4, 7, 10, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 6, 9 and 12 months after cell therapy;
2. Effectiveness evaluation: at baseline, 4, 12, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 months after cell therapy. Safety assessment: At baseline, 4, 7, 10, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 6, 9, and 12 months after cell therapy;
3. Exploratory study: 20ml peripheral blood was collected from patients at baseline, 7 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months after cell therapy, to explore the relationship between the proliferation and survival time of Hi-TCR-T cells in vivo and the changes of disease and peripheral blood cytokines.

This study aims to explore gender-specific variations in clinical management and their impact on mortality, complications, and survival rates in gastric carcinoma patients in Germany.

Methods: This nationwide, retrospective cohort study will analyze data from the German Diagnosis-Related Group statistic and regional clinical cancer registries from 2017 to 2021. The study will evaluate both datasets separately, providing a comprehensive view of gender differences in gastric cancer care. Primary outcomes include hospital mortality and survival rates, while secondary endpoints include surgical complications, treatment modalities, and postoperative outcomes. The analysis will investigate whether gender influences tumor characteristics, access to treatment, and therapy effectiveness. Statistical methods such as descriptive analysis, regression models, and survival analysis will be applied to identify gender-related variations in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes.

It consists of 21 items, each rated on a 0 to 3 scale, with total scores ranging from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. Score interpretations are generally categorized as minimal (0-13), mild (14-19), moderate (20-28), and severe (29-63). In this study, the BDI will be administered at multiple time points to monitor changes in participants' emotional well-being and track potential improvements or worsening of depressive symptoms during the intervention period., Baseline (V1), Post-Intervention (Day 28) (V2), and Follow-up (Day 56) (V3).|Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a 21-item self-report scale developed to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 3 scale, with total scores ranging from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate more severe anxiety. The BAI evaluates symptoms such as nervousness, dizziness, inability to relax, and fear of losing control. Score ranges are commonly interpreted as minimal (0-7), mild (8-15), moderate (16-25), and severe (26-63). In this study, the BAI will be used to assess anxiety levels at baseline and post-intervention to evaluate the emotional effects of the essential oil inhalation program., Baseline (V1), Post-Intervention (Day 28) (V2), and Follow-up (Day 56) (V3).|Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess sleep quality and disturbances over a one-month period. It consists of 19 items covering seven domains, including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. The total PSQI score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality. A score above 5 is typically used to identify individuals with significant sleep disturbances., Baseline (V1), Post-Intervention (Day 28) (V2), and Follow-up (Day 56) (V3).|36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) assesses health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across eight domains, including physical functioning, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status. It provides Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Summary scores.

The MEAD is a non-invasive tool based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles and operates by measuring electrical conductivity at specific acupoints along the 12 primary meridians. By applying a mild electrical current, the device detects skin resistance and calculates conductivity levels, which reflect the flow and balance of energy (Qi) within each meridian. Variations in conductivity may be associated with autonomic nervous system function, organ system imbalance, or stress-related physiological changes. This assessment will help determine whether the intervention modulates meridian energy patterns in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)., Baseline (V1), Post-Intervention (Day 28) (V2), and Follow-up (Day 56) (V3).|Heart rate variability (HRV) assessment, Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured at baseline and post-intervention to assess autonomic nervous system activity. HRV refers to the variation in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats and is widely used as a non-invasive indicator of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system balance. Higher HRV generally reflects greater parasympathetic (vagal) activity and better adaptability to physiological stress, while lower HRV may be associated with stress, fatigue, or dysregulation of autonomic function. In this study, HRV analysis will be used to explore whether the intervention modulates autonomic regulation in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Measurements will be taken under resting conditions to ensure consistency., Baseline (V1), Post-Intervention (Day 28) (V2), and Follow-up (Day 56) (V3).",,China Medical University Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,100,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE",CMUH113-REC1-180,2025-04,2027-02,2027-02,2025-03-30,,2025-03-30,"Everan Hospital, Taichung, 411, Taiwan",

NCT06902142,Prospective Multicenter Study of the Relationship Between Virological Effectiveness and Compliance in HIV-1-infected Patients Treated With Bictegravir,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06902142,BICTECAPS,RECRUITING,"Modern once-daily antiretroviral therapies have evolved considerably, improving patients' quality of life. However, sub-optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) can lead to insufficient viral suppression and the emergence of resistant HIV strains. In particular, several populations encountered in HIV clinical practice face obstacles to optimal adherence.

The investigators propose the prospective multicenter cohort study BICTECAPS, evaluating the effectiveness of the combination therapy bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) in routine practice. The investigators hypothesize that the pharmacokinetic profile and genetic barrier provided by B/F/TAF will enable a high rate of virological suppression at low to moderate levels of adherence, probably 100% virological suppression above 70% adherence.

The study is planned to include 120 patients with HIV infection treated with B/F/TAF, over a planned 2-year period with usual follow-up.

The aim of this work is to evaluate virological suppression rates at 6 and 12 months according to adherence levels defined by electronic antiretroviral monitoring caps (MEMS caps) and by intra-cellular TAF assay on blotting paper (dried blood spot, DBS).

The investigators hope to generate real-life data on B/F/TAF use from population groups generally under-represented in clinical trials, including robust measurements of adherence patterns using MEMS caps and DBS.

NCT06901986,Health Benefits of Tart Cherry in Crohn's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06901986,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a long-term inflammatory condition of the digestive tract. People with CD often experience unpredictable and debilitating symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. Additionally, they require long-term treatment, which is often associated with frequent negative effects, the need for surgery, and hospitalizations. As a result, individuals with CD report a lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared to healthy individuals.

The most common medication for inflammatory bowel disease is a strong immunosuppressant, which was identified in 2017 as the most expensive medication prescribed in NHS hospitals. Unfortunately, biologics have significant side effects, and reducing the reliance on them could benefit both the NHS by lowering costs and patients by minimizing unwanted side effects.

Supplementation with Montmorency tart cherry juice may offer a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for improving symptoms in individuals with CD. This is due to its potential to naturally reduce inflammation in the digestive system, thereby alleviating symptoms. Research in animal models has shown potential improvements in physiological responses with similar supplements, including blueberries, black raspberries, and Montmorency tart cherries, though only one study in human participants has explored bilberry supplementation.

Despite Montmorency tart cherries having superior anthocyanin concentrations compared to other berries, dietary interventions using tart cherry supplementation for CD have not been explored in human participants.

Known risk factors include age, gender, cigarettes, genetic factors, and other environmental influences .

BC can be classified into non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) . MIBC exhibits a more aggressive nature, correlates with a higher level of T-stage, and has more significant genetic heterogeneity .

Despite comprehensive treatment regimens comprising neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radical cystectomy (RC) and adjuvant immunotherapies, a significant proportion of MIBC patients continue to progress to more advanced stages with limited clinical indicators.

Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying BC initiation, proliferation, and progression remain largely unknown.

The occurrence of genetic alterations is believed to be closely linked to BC tumorigenesis. Therefore, investigating the genetic alterations might offer opportunities to further understand biological changes in BC .

A key mechanism underlying tumor progression and metastasis is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with increased invasiveness, chemoresistance, and immune evasion.

EMT is characterized by the downregulation of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin (CDH1) and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers like N-cadherin (CDH2), vimentin, Snail, and ZEB proteins .

Emerging evidence suggests that junctional adhesion molecule 3 (JAM3) plays a role in EMT and cancer progression, with documented involvement in gastric cancer.

However, its significance in MIBC remains poorly understood. Investigating JAM3 expression in MIBC may provide novel prognostic insights and help refine patient stratification for NAC and immunotherapy.

Aim:

This study aims to analyze JAM3 expression in transurethral biopsies from MIUC patients and correlate it with:

* Tumor aggressiveness (grading, staging, and histological features).
* Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
* Patient survival and disease progression.

This study will provide a better understanding of JAM3's role in EMT and MIUC progression, offering potential biomarker-driven insights for treatment stratification.

While most TNs are benign, the primary clinical goal is to exclude malignancy, which occurs in 4-6.5% of cases. Risk factors for TNs include age, gender, iodine imbalance, family history, and radiation exposure. Thyroid cancer incidence has risen due to improved diagnostic methods such as ultrasound, FNAC, CT, MRI, and PET scans.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy (90%), followed by follicular, Hurthle cell, medullary, and anaplastic carcinomas. Most thyroid cancers have an excellent prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 98.6%. FNAC is the gold standard for diagnosing TNs, and the Bethesda system (TBSRTC) categorizes cytology results into six groups with varying malignancy risks. The ""suspicious for malignancy"" category (74% risk) includes mostly suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma (SPTC), but false positives occur, especially in cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

SPTC diagnosis can be challenging, leading to potential overtreatment. To improve diagnostic accuracy, additional techniques like detailed ultrasonographic criteria, intraoperative frozen section, and molecular marker testing are used. Cytomorphometric analysis has been explored for distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions, assessing nuclear size, shape, and chromatin patterns. Most studies have focused on histological sections, but applying morphometry to cytology could enhance automated and accurate diagnoses.

Molecular studies reveal that PTCs primarily arise from MAPK pathway mutations, with BRAFV600E being the most common (60%). This mutation is strongly associated with aggressive tumor behavior and recurrence. BRAFV600E testing combined with FNAC significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, increasing sensitivity from 76.71% (mutation testing alone) to 96.62% when combined with cytology.

Although no cure exists, functional independence and participation in society remain top priorities, and can be achieved through targeted physical activity (PA) interventions. To date, few longitudinal cohort studies have been conducted, using PA as main outcome in therapy research, partly due to the complex nature of predicting and controlling this phenomenon. To help address this knowledge gap, the overall purpose of the future long-term (ActivPARK) study is to enhance knowledge of the evolution of PA behavior, and how it is influenced beyond the disease characteristics using a broad explanatory model, in persons with PD from a diversity of settings in Sweden with the aim of prescribing tailored and personalized interventions to enhance functioning, health, and wellbeing throughout the disease progression and recommend potential health care pathway modifications.

The investigators have just established an expert group, comprising researchers, healthcare professionals, and PD organisations (including persons with PD) and reached consensus on essential priority clinical therapy research questions on PA and methodological considerations.

NCT06901700,Effects of Home-based Lower Extremity Muscle Power Training on Functional Muscle and Balance Performance in Older Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06901700,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background: Muscle power, defined as the rate at which muscular force is generated to produce movement, declines more rapidly with age than muscle strength. The decline in lower extremity muscle power is associated with reduced functional independence, impaired mobility, and an increased risk of falls among older adults. While power training has been shown to improve muscle power, balance, and functional abilities, the feasibility and effectiveness of home-based interventions have not been thoroughly investigated.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of home-based lower extremity muscle power training program on functional muscle and balance performance in older adults.

Methods: This is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Forty community-dwelling older adults will be recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=20) and control group (n=20). Participants in the experimental group will complete 24 sessions of home-based lower extremity muscle power training targeting the lower limb muscle groups in 8 weeks. The training intensity will be adjusted every two weeks to gradually increase the challenge of the exercises. Participants in the control group will maintain their daily activities. In addition, both groups will receive health education. Primary outcomes include functional muscle power measured by the Four-Step Stair Climb Power Test, functional muscle strength measured by Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test, and the functional balance performance measured by the Mini-BESTest, and Timed Up and Go Test. The fall confidence, as the secondary outcome, will be measured by Falls Efficacy Scale International.

NCT06901635,The EFFECT of DIFFERENT COGNITIVE TASKS on MANUAL DEXTERITY and DUAL TASK PERFORMANCE in GERIATRIC INDIVIDUALS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06901635,,RECRUITING,"Aging is a natural, universal and inevitable process seen in all living things. With aging, structural and functional irreversible degenerative changes occur in molecules, cells, tissues, organs and systems in living organisms(Beğer \& Yavuzer, 2012). These changes, which extend from cells to systems in aging, may cause limitations in the functions necessary for elderly individuals to maintain their daily life activities such as walking, balance, coordination, visual and auditory skills, cognitive skills and dexterity. (Soyuer \& İsmailoğulları, 2009), (Yücel \& Bumin, 2010).WHO defines old age as the period between 65-74 years of age as young old age, 75-84 years of age as middle-aged, and 85 years and older as old age (old age). (Beğer \& Yavuzer, 2012), (Psychogeriatric, 1972) Manual dexterity is the ability to move an object in a desired manner and is necessary to carry out activities of daily living. Decreases in dexterity may occur with aging, which leads to limitation of activities of daily living. (Scherder et al., 2008).Impaired dexterity leads to a progressive deterioration in the performance of activities of daily living that require the use of the hands. Therefore, the ability of older adults to live comfortably and independently is negatively affected. (Vasylenko et al., 2018). Numerous factors such as loss of grip strength, sensory disabilities, decreased vision, neuro-muscular problems and cognitive decline can lead to impaired dexterity in older adults. (Carmeli et al., 2003). It has been shown that there is a further decline in dexterity with increasing age. (Desrosiers et al., 1994) One of the reasons affecting manual dexterity in the elderly is cognitive functions. Cognitive functions are a set of functions that enable the perception and understanding of all kinds of inputs received from the sensory organs. These functions include alertness, attention, memory, executive functions, planning, abstraction, language skills, time-space orientation and arithmetic. As with all physiological structures, cognitive functions are also impaired with aging (Poyraz, 2017), (Öktem, 2016). As age advances, impairments in cognitive functions become more noticeable (Kortebein \& Means, 2012) The term Dual Task (DT) refers to the ability to perform a cognitive and a motor task simultaneously. The addition of a concurrent cognitive task while performing a motor task often leads to impairment in motor task performance, referred to as the dual task effect (DTE) or dual task cost (DTCC). (Beurskens et al., 2016) Motor control and executive function are key elements of IG ability, and both are negatively affected by the aging process. (Beurskens \& Bock, 2013)Many of the activities of daily living of older adults require dual tasks, such as reading while walking or talking while using cutlery.\[ (Falbo et al., 2016)Therefore, the ability to perform IG is essential for older adults to maintain functional independence. (Verghese et al., 2011) In previous studies, it was observed that when a second cognitive task was given while performing a motor task, motor task and cognitive task decreased; however, the effects of different cognitive tasks on manual dexterity motor task and the difference between young elderly (65-74) and middle-aged (75-84) were not examined. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of cognitive tasks that affect different cognitive functions such as attention, memory and executive functions on the dexterous motor task and to evaluate and compare the differences in two different elderly groups (young and middle-aged). Our study is of great importance in terms of evaluating which cognitive functions are affected during a dual task in elderly individuals and how much dexterity is affected by these functions. Since our study is to obtain data from a certain group in a certain period of time, the type of the research was determined as a cross-sectional study. There are dependent and independent variables in the study. The study aims to examine the effect of different cognitive dual tasks added to a motor task requiring manual dexterity on manual dexterity in geriatric individuals in two different age groups. In this context, the independent variables in the study are the type of cognitive task and age. In total, 4 different cognitive tasks were determined. The dependent variable is dexterity performance. The extent to which dexterity will be affected by 4 different cognitive task types and age will be examined.",NO,Dual Task Cost,OTHER: Dual Task,"Box and Block Test, The Box and Block Test is a quick, simple and inexpensive test that can be used in various populations to measure unilateral gross manual dexterity. The box and block test consists of a wooden box divided into two compartments by a board and 150 wooden blocks of 2.5 cm3. In the box block test, the person is asked to move the maximum number of blocks one by one from one compartment of the box to the other compartment of equal size within 60 seconds. A trial period of 15 seconds is allowed before starting the test. When placing the blocks in the other compartment, the participant's fingertips must cross the vertical plane of the compartment. The box block test has high reliability in the elderly population. It also has high reliability among manual dexterity assessors and has good criterion construct validity, 30 second","COGNITIVE TASKS(Executive Functions), Executive Functions (EF)

Participants are asked to name animals or fruits and vegetables within a certain time limit. This task has been shown to trigger activation in the frontal network and temporal lobe. This task targets executive function and semantic memory. Participants need to say words, which requires access to their mental lexicon, and they need to focus on the task, select words that meet certain constraints and avoid repetition, which involves executive control processes. Within 30 seconds, the names of animals or vegetables spoken are recorded, 30 second|COGNITIVE TASK (Working Memory ), The participant is given a number and asked to count backwards from this number.

The counting backward task is thought to engage numerical processing skills and is associated with activation in bilateral prefrontal cortices, left posterior inferior perietal lobule and left supementary motor area. The backward counting task is considered a type of mental monitoring that requires retaining information in working memory and mental processing. The counting backward task has been widely used in the literature as a working memory paradigm. Within 30 seconds, the correct numbers spoken are recorded, 30 second|COGNITIVE TASKS (Attention), A sequence of numbers is read to the participant. The participant is asked to count the number of times the number is said before the test and to say it at the end of the test.

Attention can be defined as the ability to selectively process specific information by focusing cognitive resources and ignoring other inputs from the environment. Depending on its tasks, attention can be defined as selective, divided, sustained and shifting attention. The ability to sustain attention is critical for everyday tasks that affect safety, social communication and mental health. Sustained attention is defined as the ability to maintain consistent task performance. This task is a task used to measure sustained attention., 30 second|COGNITIVE TASKS(Memory), The participant is told certain words and then asked to repeat the words back to us. the correct words spoken by the participant are recorded

This task is used to test short-term memory because the participant is asked to repeat the words immediately after being told them. Episodic memory relies on encoding and retrieval processes and is associated with activation of the bilateral prefrontal cortex. Short-term memory is generally defined as the temporary storage of information.

NCT06901570,Clinical Evaluation of Aromatic Wentong in the Treatment of Coronary Microvascular Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06901570,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is a condition where patients experience chest pain (angina) even though their coronary arteries appear normal on angiography. It is common among people with coronary heart disease, especially those with chest pain as their main symptom. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments available for these patients, and symptoms like chest tightness and persistent pain greatly affect their quality of life.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) suggests that the root cause of microvascular disease is blocked collateral blood vessels. Aromatic Wentong, a TCM approach, aims to improve blood flow and relieve blockages. Kuangxiong Aerosol is a Chinese patent medicine developed based on the principles of Aromatic Wentong.

This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 528 patients with chest pain and suspected CMD. Participants are recruited from several hospitals, including China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Fuwai Hospital, and Xiyuan Hospital. Patients are randomly divided into two groups:

NCT06901531,A Study of Zolbetuximab Together With Pembrolizumab and Chemotherapy in Adults With Gastric Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06901531,LUCERNA,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Zolbetuximab is being studied in people with cancer in and around the stomach or where the food pipe (esophagus) joins the stomach, called gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. Zolbetuximab with chemotherapy may be used to treat stomach and GEJ cancer when the cancer cells do not have a protein called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) on their surface (HER2-negative) but do have a protein called Claudin 18.2 (Claudin 18.2-positive). Zolbetuximab is thought to work by attaching to the Claudin 18.2 protein in their tumor, which switches on the body's immune system to attack the tumor. Certain stomach and GEJ cancers may be treated with immunotherapy, which helps the body's immune system fight cancer. This study will give more information about how well zolbetuximab works when given with an immunotherapy medicine called pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. In this study, adults with stomach cancer or GEJ cancer will either be given zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or a placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. A placebo looks like zolbetuximab but doesn't have any medicine in it.

The main aim of the study is to check how long people with stomach cancer and GEJ cancer live after treatment with zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy compared to placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.

Adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic stomach cancer or GEJ cancer can take part. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. A tumor sample (biopsy) of their cancer will have the Claudin 18.2 protein, PD-L1 protein, and be HER2-negative. They may have been previously treated with certain standard therapies. People cannot take part if they need to take medicines to suppress their immune system, have blockages or bleeding in their gut, have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers in the nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.

The study treatments are either zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, or placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. People who take part will receive just 1 of the study treatments by chance. The people in the study and the study doctors will not know who takes which of the study treatments. Study treatment will be given in 6-week (42-day) cycles. The study treatment is mainly given to people slowly through a tube into a vein. This is called an infusion. People will receive study treatment as follows: Zolbetuximab or placebo: 1 infusion every 2 or 3 weeks (2 or 3 infusions in a cycle) together with: Chemotherapy (1 of the following types of chemotherapy): 1. CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin): 1 infusion of oxaliplatin every 3 weeks (2 infusions in a cycle). People will also take 1 tablet of capecitabine twice a day for 2 weeks (14 days) at the start of each cycle (Day 1) and again in the middle of each cycle (Day 22). After 8 study treatments people will receive capecitabine only. 2. Modified FOLFOX6 or mFOLFOX6 (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin): 1 infusion every 2 weeks (3 infusions in a cycle). After 12 study treatments people will receive folinic acid and fluorouracil only, instead of mFOLFOX6. Pembrolizumab: 1 infusion every 3 or 6 weeks (1 or 2 infusions in a cycle). People can be in the study and will receive study treatment until their cancer worsens, they cannot tolerate the study treatment, or they need to start another cancer treatment. People may receive pembrolizumab for up to 2 years. People will visit the clinic on certain days to receive their study treatment and have health checks. The study doctors will check if people had any medical problems from taking zolbetuximab or the other study treatments. On some visits they will have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. People will have the option of giving a tumor sample if they stop treatment because their cancer has worsened. People will visit the clinic after they stop their study treatment. People will be asked about any medical problems and will have a health check. People will continue to have scans every 9 or 12 weeks to check for any changes in their cancer.

NCT06901479,The Study of Postoperative Delirium and Glymphatic System Function in Cardiac Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06901479,Delirium,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery is an acute cerebral dysfunction characterized by inattention, impaired consciousness, and cognitive and orientation disturbances. It manifests clinically as acute onset, severe neurocognitive impairment, and periodic fluctuating progression, and is one of the most common complications after major cardiac and vascular surgery. It typically occurs within one week after surgery, with a peak incidence at 24 hours postoperatively. Due to differences in the basic characteristics of study populations and assessment tools, the reported incidence of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery varies significantly, ranging from 14% to 50%. Postoperative delirium not only prolongs patients' ICU and hospital stays, increases medical costs, and raises short-term and long-term mortality rates, but is also closely associated with long-term cognitive impairment, dementia, and a decline in activities of daily living. The pathophysiology of delirium is complex and may be caused by a combination of multiple factors, including microembolism, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and systemic inflammatory response. Since the mechanisms underlying delirium are not yet fully understood, effective treatments are currently lacking. Postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery is a significant clinical challenge for medical teams.

The brain is distinct from other organs, as the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier isolate the exchange between the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and extracellular fluid. For a long time, it was believed that the brain lacks a lymphatic system, and the extracellular fluid in brain tissue was considered stagnant. The lack of fluid flow can lead to the accumulation of protein waste, which is very detrimental to brain health. The glymphatic system is a major update in the anatomical knowledge of the central nervous system in recent years. It is a highly organized fluid transport system within the human brain, with the primary function of promoting convective exchange between the interstitial fluid of the central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid. The main physiological function of the glymphatic system is to clear metabolic waste and large-molecule solutes, thereby maintaining central homeostasis; it also acts as a communicator between the brain and peripheral immunity, ensuring that the central nervous system is not overlooked by the immune system. Additionally, the glymphatic system helps deliver nutrients to the brain, such as glucose, lactate, and amino acids. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system is associated with various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and related research has become a frontier and hotspot in the field of neuroscience.

Dysfunction of the glymphatic system leads to the accumulation of β-amyloid and tau proteins in the brain, which cannot be cleared, and is one of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. There is a strong bidirectional association between Alzheimer's disease and delirium. Patients with Alzheimer's disease-related dementia are 2.5 to 4.7 times more likely to experience delirium, and the incidence of newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease-related dementia in patients with delirium increases by 12.5 times. However, the underlying mechanisms of postoperative delirium remain unclear, which has motivated our investigation into the causal relationship between the glymphatic system and postoperative delirium. From a theoretical perspective, chronic dysfunction of the glymphatic system signifies brain vulnerability and a higher incidence of neurological diseases. If subjected to surgical stress, sudden dysfunction may represent acute glymphatic system insufficiency. With the rapid development of clinical imaging tools, functional MRI is a non-invasive method for assessing glymphatic system function, bringing possibilities to clinical research.

Therefore, this study aims to explore the association between postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery and the glymphatic system, in order to deepen the understanding of glymphatic system function and investigate the mechanisms of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery, and to provide ideas for new interventions for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery.",NO,Postoperative Delirium (POD),OTHER: Blood was drawn for proteomics testing and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,"Postoperative delirium, Using the 3-Minute Diagnostic Assessment for Delirium, Postoperative delirium was assessed on postoperative days 1 to 5","Analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS), MRI indicators for assessing glymphatic system function, 1、Before surgery；2、On the fifth day after surgery|Blood was drawn for proteomics testing, 1、Before surgery; 2、On the fifth day after surgery.",,"Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,200,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,KY20250225-07,2025-03-10,2028-12-31,2028-12-31,2025-03-30,,2025-03-30,"Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210000, China",

The obese state is characterized by increased adipose tissue mass and disturbed function resulting in systemic lipid spillover and low-grade inflammation, which may contribute to the development of comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. The crosstalk between various metabolic organs such as the gut, liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle plays an important regulatory role in energy and substrate metabolism, which impacts metabolic health. The studies on the gut microbiota in host energy and substrate metabolism, \& its relation to Obesity are neumerous, includes interventions that modify the gut microbiota composition and functionality with antibiotics , prebiotics \& probiotics .

NCT06901011,Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Doses in Critically Ill Patients with Acute Kidney Injury,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06901011,CRRIT1,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Acute kidney injury in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU is a common complication associated with high mortality or long-term chronic kidney damage. Some of these patients require continuous renal replacement therapy (low-intensity hemodialysis for 24 hours) until renal function recovery is achieved.

Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) is a crucial treatment for ICU patients with acute renal failure. It offers continuous toxin removal and prevents fluid accumulation in the patient's body. The therapy not only eliminates toxins but also physiological substances, including micronutrients and essential elements for cellular metabolism and organ function.

Currently, there is limited information available to adjust the renal therapy dose and avoid or balance the loss of these substances without causing toxin accumulation. Some studies suggest that high doses of therapy do not provide benefits and increase complications.

The objective of this study is to evaluate two doses of continuous renal therapy in terms of internal environment control (sodium, potassium, and acids and bases), micronutrient loss, and toxin elimination. After 48 hours of therapy, patients will be assigned to continue with a dose equal to the initial dose or a decrease in the initial dose. These two options are part of the current standard practice in our center.

Patients participating in the study will be randomly assigned one of the continuous renal therapy doses. The study is open, so treating physicians will always know the therapy the patient is receiving and can freely adjust it if deemed necessary.

The intervention duration is 96 hours, after which the dose will be at the discretion of the treating medical team. A follow-up will be conducted through medical records or phone calls approximately 90 days after starting therapy.

The risks for the patient are minimal, as toxin elimination monitoring will be even more intensive than usual.

Colloid solutions consist of large molecules that generally cannot pass through healthy capillary membranes, whereas crystalloid solutions contain ions that easily move from the intravascular space to the interstitial compartment. Therefore, it is traditionally argued that colloids are more effective at expanding intravascular volume, with a suggested ratio of 1:3 compared to crystalloids. However, there is currently limited evidence to suggest that resuscitation with one type of fluid is more effective or safer than t he other.

This leads to symptoms in the patient, including: pain, migraines, headaches, neuropathic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, depression, anxiety, apathy, fatigue, cognitive decline, aphasia, functional motor disorders (FMD), neuromuscular tone alterations, and hyposthenia, in addition to involvement of various cognitive functions, such as decision-making, problem-solving, learning, memory, executive functions, social cognition, and emotional cognition. The presence of these neurological symptoms is often evident in a first clinical examination and is one of the main reasons for further healthcare consultations. These difficulties have a profound impact on the quality of life, affecting work, social, and family functioning.

In recent years, several non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have emerged, aimed at eliciting brain neural networks, such as transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

tSMS is an NIBS technique that involves the application of a neodymium magnet on the scalp. Since the first study proposing this method, several others have confirmed that tSMS can reduce corticospinal excitability. tDCS involves the application of weak electrical currents capable of generating an electric field that can modulate neural activity in an excitatory or inhibitory manner. NIBS techniques can be used experimentally to modulate cortical activity.

The primary aim of this proposal is to address the impact of neurological symptoms through the combination of tSMS with tDCS and rehabilitation techniques. Specifically, it aims to understand whether the combination of these neuromodulatory therapeutic NIBS methods can enhance symptom improvement in patients with neurological conditions.

To assess the impact of this intervention, a series of tests and questionnaires, described in detail below, will be used to evaluate the severity of the reported symptoms and secondary outcomes.

Moreover, the contribution of specific brain areas to the symptom will be evaluated through the direct modulation of brain activity. This modulation will be achieved using an additional NIBS technique, such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS, in particular, is a non-invasive method for stimulating neurons in the brain's superficial areas, which has been frequently used in neurology as a diagnostic and research tool since its introduction. TMS uses magnetic fields to induce electrical currents capable of facilitating or inhibiting cortical activity.",NO,Neurological Diseases or Conditions,COMBINATION_PRODUCT: transcranial static field stimulation (tSMS) and transcranial (tDCS),"Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The VAS is a self-administered scale in which patients indicate the intensity of pain experienced by selecting a point on a continuous line ranging from 0 to 100 mm, representing the absence of pain to the worst pain, respectively., Change from baseline at one week","Neurological clinical assessment through the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a clinician-administered assessment scale evaluating the functional systems of the central nervous system.

After ruling out celiac disease, wheat allergy, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using the Rome IV criteria, the patients will be invited to the clinic. The study's objectives, methods, and procedures will be explained, and written informed consent will be obtained from patients who are willing to participate.

At the start of the study, each patient's weight will be measured while wearing light clothing using a mechanical scale (with an accuracy of 100 grams), and height will be measured without shoes using a wall-mounted meter (with an accuracy of 0.5 cm). The body mass index (BMI) of the patients will then be calculated. Additionally, general patient information will be recorded on the data collection form, and the gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaire (NCGS-SQ) will be completed.

Next, blood sample will be drawn from the patients after fasting for 8 to 12 hours, and their serum will be collected to measure glycemic indices, including FBS, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA-IR. A gluten-free diet (GFD) will be designed by a nutritionist to maintain the weight of type 2 diabetic patients and must be followed for 6 weeks. Carbohydrate distribution and diabetes-related recommendations will also be provided for the patients.

Patient follow-up will be conducted via phone calls to ensure adherence to the diet and to prevent sample loss. Diet compliance will be assessed by a nutritionist, who will review the intake of any gluten-containing foods.

After six weeks (Phase 1), glycemic indices will be re-evaluated through blood tests. Patients who have adhered to the diet optimally and experienced significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms will be suspected of having NCGS. If they agree, they will remain in the study and participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. Those who do not show improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms during the first six weeks will be excluded from the study.

In Phase 2, both the patients and the researchers assessing them will be blinded to the treatment being studied. Intervention group (gluten group) will receive 3 grams of gluten, and control group (placebo group) will receive 3 grams of corn starch powder, to be consumed daily mixed with milk or another beverage.

Study Design:

The study employs a stepped-wedge design, whereby clusters of hospitals transition sequentially from a control phase (routine care) to an intervention phase. All patient data are collected retrospectively from routine care, while prospective data are gathered at the healthcare professional level. The project spans four years and involves hospitals from the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Romania, Poland, and Ukraine. This design allows for comparison of HIV testing rates and related outcomes before and after the implementation across different settings and time points.

Intervention:

The core intervention involves the establishment of hospital-based HIV teams. Each team is led by an HIV specialist and supported by nurses and data collectors. Their responsibilities include:

Identification and Surveillance: Screening routine electronic health records for HIV indicator conditions using predefined ICD-10 codes and verifying cases that warrant HIV testing.

Audit \& Feedback: Providing targeted recommendations to treating physicians when an HIV test is indicated but has not been performed, thereby prompting action.

Education \& Training: Delivering training sessions to healthcare professionals to improve their knowledge and attitudes towards HIV testing, prevention, and care.

Enabling Environment: Implementing digital solutions and other support mechanisms to streamline testing processes, reduce stigma, and enhance overall guideline adherence.

Linkage to prevention: Improving linkage to the locally available preventive services.

The intervention is intended to integrate seamlessly into routine hospital care, thereby reinforcing existing guidelines while addressing the current diagnostic testing gap.

Endpoints and Outcome Measures:

Primary Endpoint:

The change in HIV testing rate among patients diagnosed with HIV indicator conditions before and after the implementation of HIV teams.

Key Secondary Endpoints:

The change in the incidence of new HIV diagnoses among patients with HIV indicator conditions.

Variations in HIV testing rates across different countries, medical specialties, and types of indicator conditions, as well as over time.

Assessment of the cascade of HIV diagnosis, including the proportion of patients identified with an indicator condition, the offer and acceptance of HIV testing, and documented reasons for non-testing.

Evaluation of the cascade of HIV care and prevention, including linkage to HIV care, achievement of viral suppression, and referral and uptake of preventive services.

Changes in healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and levels of stigma towards HIV.

Implementation outcomes such as fidelity of HIV team activities, resource utilization, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of the intervention.

Analysis of contextual factors, barriers, and facilitators impacting the implementation process, using established frameworks like CFIR and RE-AIM.

Impact:

By introducing HIV teams and systematically monitoring their effect on HIV testing practices, the study aims to enhance early HIV diagnosis and improve patient outcomes. The findings will contribute to evidence-based guidelines and may promote the adoption of similar interventions across European healthcare settings, ultimately reducing HIV-associated morbidity, mortality, and transmission rates.

Traditional markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin are useful but are either invasive or disliked by patients and a proper continuous monitoring is not feasible with fragmented biomarker information.

The NimBio technology provides support for the clinicians who are managing IBD patients' care based on a wearable technology that allows tracking responsiveness of blood flow properties (also called hemorheology) to inflammatory processes. NimBio's technology analyses blood flow properties using photoplethysmography (PPG), an optical signal, which detects blood flow changes in the microvascular bed of tissues. The PPG signal is obtained from a commercially available wearable (bracelet) which is convenient for the patients. Based on the impact of inflammation on parameters influencing hemorheology (mainly blood vessel stiffness, blood viscosity and red blood cell aggregation) and the fact that the PPG signal mirrors blood flow characteristics, PPG measurements are associated with changes in inflammatory biomarkers and therefore correlate with disease activity.

NCT06900673,Reducing Disparities in Access to Evidence-Based Services for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Through Technology,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06900673,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"This project aims to develop an adaptation of the Collaborative Life Skills Program (CLS) that will be supported by mHealth technology. CLS is an evidence-based intervention for 2nd-5th grade children with ADHD that is delivered in schools through coordinated efforts among school mental health providers, teachers, and parents. School mental health providers are trained to coordinate evidence-based teacher- (i.e., Daily Behavioral Report Card) and parent-mediated (i.e., Behavioral Parent Training) behavioral interventions, and lead child social and organizational skills training groups. The adapted intervention, which integrates mHealth technology (CLS-M), will improve the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of CLS in schools with limited resources serving children from low-socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnic/racial minority (ERM) backgrounds, reducing disparities in access to evidence-based ADHD interventions in these populations. Barriers to service use in schools where low-SES and ERM families are most likely to receive services include logistical constraints (e.g., time, transportation, childcare, work schedules), perceptual barriers (e.g., cultural mistrust, stigma, perceived efficacy), and insufficient resources (e.g., staff, time, consultation support). Building on prior research, the investigators will develop and test a fully functional web-based mHealth application to support CLS-M that includes an integrated user portal for school mental health providers, teachers, and parents. The application will also include separate interfaces that support key features to facilitate each person's role in CLS implementation at school or at home, such as access to shared information about child assessments, goals, and automatically generated graphs of child Daily Behavioral Report Card performance. Messaging features will facilitate communication among school mental health providers, parents, and teachers, and calendar features that integrate with third- party calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar) will facilitate scheduling, meeting tracking, and sharing links to third-party videoconferencing applications (e.g., Zoom). Based on stakeholder feedback from school administrators, school mental health providers, teachers, and parents, the investigators will work with mobile application developers to design a fully functional web-based mHealth application prototype to support the CLS-M protocol. the investigators will then test and refine the prototype through a series of individual usability tests and an open feasibility trial. the investigators will also collect formative data from stakeholders in rural schools in Imperial County to inform future research on adapting CLS-M for low-SES and ERM families served in this setting. Finally, the investigators will conduct a Hybrid Type I cluster randomized trial in 24 schools in a large urban school district, to evaluate whether CLS-M results in acceptable implementation outcomes and improved child outcomes in comparison to usual school services. The specific aims are to 1) Develop CLS-M and test its usability, feasibility, and acceptability among key stakeholders; 2) Collect formative data to inform future CLS-M adaptations for families living in rural settings; and 3) Evaluate CLS-M implementation and impact on child outcomes relative to typical school services.",NO,Control Condition|Intervention Condition,BEHAVIORAL: Collaborative Life Skills,"Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5, Parents and teachers will complete the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5 , which includes 78 items assessing DSM-5 symptoms of ADHD, ODD, CD, Mood, and Anxiety.

Among men living with HIV, alcohol use is associated with non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and a detectable viral load, increasing the risk of onward HIV transmission to partners. This risk is further heightened when the partner is pregnant, due to the potential for vertical transmission. Therefore, addressing factors that interfere with optimal HIV care outcomes among men living with HIV is critical to HIV prevention in pregnant women.

The goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to pilot test an intervention that combines alcohol reduction and economic strengthening to improve ART adherence. The study will assess implementation outcomes and preliminary efficacy among men living with HIV who engage in hazardous alcohol use and their pregnant partners (n=30 couples). The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. What are the implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, and safety) at the individual, implementer, and organizational levels, and what bridging factors may impede success (e.g., community-academic partnership)?
2. Does the intervention reduce hazardous alcohol use and improve ART adherence among men living with HIV?

Researchers will compare the intervention group (n=15 couples) to the standard of care group (n=15 couples) to determine if the intervention leads to behavior change in alcohol use and ART adherence among men living with HIV.

Participants will:

1. Men in the intervention group will receive the Amaka intervention, designed to reduce alcohol use and improve ART adherence.
2. Complete assessments on hazardous alcohol use, ART adherence, and implementation outcomes at multiple time points (baseline, 3 and 6 months).

It is known that some clinical and biochemical parameters of the disease have been recognized as prognostic factors; however, it has been described that a reduction in the overall global quality of life score, mainly by physical function, increased pain, and dysphagia, are associated with mortality, and having high social well-being and global quality of life scores are associated with a lower risk of death.

Objective: This study will measure association between Health-Related Quality of Life levels and mortality and progression free survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients

Patients and methods:

This study will include patients with lung cancer histopathological confirmed including bronchus or trachea.

Methodologically, the study has two components: One related to the exposure variable (HRQL), which involves a scale validation study, and other related to the measurement of the association between HRQoL and survival outcomes, which involves a prospective cohort analytical observational study.

In addition to psychological and emotional factors, healthcare professionals can contribute to the development of chronic disabilities in their patients by promoting hypervigilance and restricting normal activities, potentially reinforcing or altering patients' perceptions, leading to limited mobility. Existing scientific literature suggests that patients with chronic pain often feel they do not receive sufficient information from healthcare professionals that could help them better understand and manage pain, thereby improving their quality of life.

Objectives:

1. To assess the current knowledge of pain neurophysiology among primary care professionals (medicine, physiotherapy, nursing, nutrition, and psychology) in Spain.
2. To evaluate attitudes and beliefs about chronic low back pain among primary care professionals (medicine, physiotherapy, nursing, nutrition, and psychology) in Spain.
3. To examine fear-avoidance beliefs related to pain among primary care professionals (medicine, physiotherapy, nursing, nutrition, and psychology) in Spain.

Methodology: A cross-sectional descriptive study will be conducted to collect information from primary care health professionals (medicine, physiotherapy, psychology, nutrition, and nursing) in Spain, focusing on their current knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about musculoskeletal pain.

Applicability: This study will provide valuable insights into the current state of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about musculoskeletal pain among primary care health professionals in Spain. The findings will guide future educational interventions and policy recommendations to improve the management of musculoskeletal pain in primary care settings in Spain.

Characterized by symptoms such as foul odor, heavy exudate, bleeding, moderate to severe pain, and infection, MFWs cause significant physical discomfort and pose life-threatening risks while also leading to profound psychosocial issues, including shame and social isolation. These factors severely impact patients' quality of life, with half of those diagnosed surviving only six months on average.

However, clinical nursing staff often lack adequate knowledge and skills in managing MFWs, with an average accuracy rate of just 56.5%. Notable deficiencies exist in areas such as wound disinfection, odor control, and wound assessment, directly affecting the quality of patient care and highlighting an urgent need for specialized MFW training. Traditional MFW education often lacks real-life clinical scenarios and hands-on practice, resulting in a gap between learning and application and leaving learners ill-prepared for the complexities of clinical settings.

In contrast, augmented reality (AR) technology presents new possibilities for nursing education. AR can create highly simulated clinical environments where learners can safely practice complex clinical skills, enhancing clinical decision-making abilities.

Rotator cuff syndrome is a common shoulder disorder caused by excessive use, muscle weakness, trauma, or instability, leading to pain, restricted movement, and reduced functional capacity. Although percussion massage therapy has gained popularity for its potential therapeutic benefits, there is limited scientific evidence on its effectiveness in improving ROM, pain reduction, and functional outcomes.

A total of 48 participants diagnosed with rotator cuff lesions will be included in the study and divided into three groups:

Vibration Group (33 Hz) Vibration Group (16.7 Hz) Control Group (Conventional Physiotherapy)

The intervention will include:

Conventional physiotherapy exercises applied to all groups, Vibration therapy with a percussion massage gun applied to the experimental groups, targeting the deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles for three minutes per muscle, three times per week for three weeks.

Outcome Measures:

Pain: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ROM \& Joint Position Sense: Measured using the Goniometer Pro mobile application Functionality: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire Quality of Life: Rotator Cuff Quality of Life (RC-QoL) questionnaire

Hypotheses:

Vibration therapy at different frequencies will significantly impact pain, ROM, functionality, joint position sense, and quality of life.

33 Hz vibration therapy will be more effective than 16.7 Hz in improving outcomes.

It achieves adequate tissue penetration in the skin, bones, joints, lung tissues, and peritoneal space, maintaining concentrations above the MIC for susceptible Gram-positive pathogen.

DAL is a bactericidal antimicrobial agent that binds the C-terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine on the bacterial cell wall, blocking trans-glycosylation and transpeptidation processes essential for cell wall synthesis. It seems also to be able to enhance neutrophil antibacterial activity improving PMNs' intracellular killing of MRSA. It has also a good antibiofilm activity, alone or in combination with other molecules. Like other glycopeptide molecules, DAL shares a similar spectrum of activity, with demonstrated in vitro activity against various Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus (faecium, and faecalis). Resistance to DAL is possible in these gram-positives bacteria, given to presence of enzymes that produce low-affinity binding precursors for the antibiotic's binding site.

The goal of this clinical trial is to see if placing a prosthetic over patients' skull defects can prevent ""Sunken Flap Syndrome.""

The main questions are:

1. Can placing a prosthetic device over patients' skull defects prevent Sunken Flap Syndrome?
2. Can placing a prosthetic device over patients' skull defects decrease healthcare costs?
3. Can placing a prosthetic device over patients' skull defects improve recovery and return of brain function after decompressive craniectomy?

Patients that experience traumatic brain injuries, brain bleeds, and large strokes can build up high levels of pressure in the skull. When this pressure can't be controlled with medications, a life-saving surgery called a decompressive hemicraniectomy (DC) is often performed. In this surgery, a large portion of the patient's skull is removed to decrease pressure on the brain and decrease permanent damage.

After this surgery, many patients experience sinking of the brain in the skull as the pressure inside the head improves. The skull normally protects the brain from the outside environment. When large parts of the skull are removed, the brain is not able to regulate itself normally. This can lead to a number of problems, such as headaches, weakness, seizures, and even coma and permanent brain damage. This is referred to as ""Sunken Flap Syndrome"" (SFS) or ""Syndrome of the Trephined"" (SoT). After 3-6 months, patients can have the missing skull surgically repaired, which improves and sometimes fixes SFS, but the damage is sometimes too severe to be reversed.

There are reports of patients with SFS treated with custom-made prosthetics that cover the missing piece of skull. In this study, the researchers want to see if wearing a custom-made prosthetic can prevent patients from experiencing SFS. Patients will also receive additional non-invasive measurement to see if the prosthetic can improve brain function and recovery. Finally, the researchers want to know if the prosthetic is cost-effective by decreasing the frequency that patients see doctors or receive care to treat SFS.

Patients or the patient's medical decision makers will be asked if the patient wants to participate in the study after DC. If the patient or decision maker agrees to participate, the patient will be also asked if the patient wants to wear the prosthetic. The prosthetic is made of a common material used in other facial prosthetics. Patients that agree to wear the prosthetic will have a custom plate made for the participant.

All patients will receive the same post-operative care and appointments whether or not the prosthetic is worn. The participant will go to the normally scheduled post-operative doctor's appointments at 2 and 4 weeks after initial DC surgery. Patient's that agree to wear the prosthetic will receive it at the 4-week post-DC appointment. The participant will then be asked to wear it as much as possible, but to let the researchers know if the participant experiences any pain, itching, discomfort or other problems.

All patients will also be seen by the patient's physician before and after and after skull repair. At all appointments, patients will receive non-invasive testing of brain function. Recovery and rate of SFS will be compared between patients that do and do not wear the prosthetic.

Participants will:

* Go to the normally scheduled 2 and 4 week post-DC appointments
* Go to the normally scheduled pre- and post-skull repair appointments
* Receive additional non-invasive brain health testing at each appointment

Participants that agree to wear a prosthetic will:

* Receive the custom prosthetic at the 4-week post-DC appointment
* Wear the prosthetic as much as possible, including at night
* Take a brief survey about the prosthetic at the post-skull repair appointment",NO,Craniectomy|Trephined Syndrome|Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Patients|Ischemic Stroke,DEVICE: External Cranial Prosthesis,"Incidence of Sunken Flap Syndrome, Sunken Flap Syndrome will be defined as development of new neurologic symptoms after acute injury and craniectomy that improve quickly post-cranioplasty (ie. between pre- and post-cranioplasty appointments).

The gut microbiome has a number of important functions not only in the gut but within the whole body. Changes to your child's nutritional status throughout treatment may affect how well they recover from treatment. This study will monitor the impact of feeding and nutrition on nutritional status and gut health in young people undergoing treatment for leukaemia. The measurements needed to observe nutritional and gut microbiomes will occur when your child attends their routine medical appointments at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Medical treatment uses chemicals to kill leukaemia cells. The type of medications used in the treatment of leukaemia can damage the gut resulting in inflammation call mucositis. This stops the gut from working and sometimes nutrition has to be provided via a feeding tube or intravenous. Chemotherapy, mucositis and intravenous nutrition all have an impact on the gut. Little is know how the gut health recovers after treatment for leukaemia. This will be the first study to specifically monitor the impact of feeding and nutritional on gut health in children undergoing treatment for leukaemia.

The risk of developing cirrhosis in people with chronic HCV infection ranges between 15% and 30% over a period of 20 years (2).

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the global strategy for eliminating viral hepatitis (Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B). The goals for hepatitis C include a 90% reduction in new cases of infection and a 65% reduction in mortality (3). To achieve this target by 2030, 90% of people living with hepatitis C need to be diagnosed, and 80% of those individuals must receive treatment, along with reducing the incidence of HCV in high-risk groups (4, 5).

According to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO), 58 million people are living with chronic hepatitis C infection, (2).

Based on information from Colombia's High-Cost Account (CAC), between January 1 and December 31, 2021, 962 people with the infection were identified in Colombia (6). The CAC report for 2021 indicates that the prevalence of chronic HCV was 442, 173, 102, 089, and 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for Barranquilla, Soledad, Montería, Cartagena, and Santa Marta, respectively (7). The most common modes of transmission were sexual (72.1%) and parenteral/percutaneous (11.8% of cases) (8).

According to data published by the Polaris Observatory as of 2021, the prevalence in Colombia was estimated at 0.67% (320,000 cases), According to their projections, Colombia is expected to achieve the WHO targets by 2051 under current conditions (9).

Fewer than half of Latin American countries have conducted prevalence studies for HCV, and most of those studies have poor design quality. When extrapolating data from countries with records, the estimated HCV prevalence rate in Latin America is less than 1%. According to the Polaris Observatory's 2019 epidemiological data,only Brazil treated enough patients to achieve a net annual cure rate above 1% of those infected (10).

In France, 61% of households own a pet, highlighting the significant role pets play in the daily lives. Patients diagnosed with brain tumors face specific challenges that may affect their ability to care their pets, including:

* Progressive neurological deficits (cognitive and/or motor), limiting their autonomy,
* A life-threatening prognosis.

In this context, the well-being of pets when their owner's health deteriorates becomes a critical concern. Indeed:

* Social isolation and the progressive loss of physical and cognitive abilities complicate pet care, particularly during prolonged hospitalizations or in the event of death,
* The lack of appropriate facilities and care solutions causes stress for pets, who are often unprepared for such transitions, and adds to the emotional burden on patients.

Why focus on patients with brain tumors?

* These patients have specific needs due to the rapid progression of their condition,
* A local study showed that 12% of patients with gliomas live alone, a significantly higher rate than in other cancer types. Patients who live alone are particularly exposed to issues related to their pet's future,

NCT06899295,Prevention of Postoperative Respiratory Complications,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06899295,RAMAGE,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Given the huge number of patients mechanically ventilated during general anaesthesia, optimizing alveolar recruitment by limiting pulmonary and systemic aggression is a key objective for further progress in perioperative patient management.

During general anaesthesia, ventilation disorders with atelectasis, derecruitment of posteroinferior zones and reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) occur in relation to the operative position, the effect of neuromuscular block and general anaesthesia. These conditions of poor pulmonary aeration favor postoperative respiratory complications and are responsible for excess mortality in the perioperative period.

Alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs) are ventilatory strategies used during general anesthesia that aim to restore lung aeration with Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) sufficient to keep the lungs open afterwards. This pulmonary hyperinflation not only has a major impact on hemodynamics but also presents a risk of barotrauma. ARM is currently performed without precise measurement of the pressures prevailing in the lung.

Advanced monitoring is now available and integrated into the latest-generation ventilators and includes the combination of Transpulmonary pressure (TPP) and Electro-Impedance Tomography "" (EIT) measurements.

The aim of this observational study is to measure and record advanced respiratory monitoring data in a minimally invasive way, during alveolar recruitment tests routinely performed for the target population (obese, prone, laparoscopic surgery).

NCT06899087,DEciphering CIrculating SIgnatures Of Infected Pancreatic Necrosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06899087,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The purpose of the study is to identify novel blood-based biomarkers for prediction and diagnosis of infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis (NP).

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the leading cause of gastrointestinal hospital admissions, accounting for over 300,000 emergency department visits annually and imposing a significant socio-economic burden. It is an acute inflammatory condition of the pancreas characterized by damage to the acinar cells, which triggers an inflammatory response and causes widespread systemic damage. In about 20% of cases, the disease progresses to necrotizing pancreatitis (NP), a severe form characterized by tissue necrosis. NP poses serious health risks, especially when the necrotic tissue becomes infected, leading to infected (peri-)pancreatic necrosis (IPN), which is associated with secondary organ failure (OF), sepsis, and mortality rates as high as 40%. While patients with sterile (peri-)pancreatic necrosis (SPN) can often be managed conservatively, those with IPN typically require antibiotics and therapeutic interventions such as endoscopic drainage or surgery.

Timely recognition and treatment of IPN are crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet current diagnostic methods based on clinical symptoms and routine lab markers lack the specificity to reliably distinguish SPN from IPN in the early stages. Furthermore, while multifactorial scoring systems like Ranson, Imrie, and APACHE II predict necrosis and overall severity in AP, they are not accurate for identifying IPN or predicting mortality in NP. The diagnostic gap delays appropriate treatment, allowing the infection to advance and limiting available therapeutic options. The growing incidence and significant impact of AP and NP in the general population underscore the urgent need to better understand IPN pathophysiology and to develop specific diagnostic biomarkers that can improve prognosis, guide therapeutic decisions, and enhance patient outcomes.",NO,Acute Pancreatitis,OTHER: not interventional,"Understand immune-metabolic dynamics in NP, by assessing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and plasma metabolites, 3 months|Identify novel biomarkers, Using venous blood samples, 3 months",,,University of Minnesota,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,45,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,DECISION,2025-06-01,2026-09-01,2026-12-01,2025-03-27,,2025-03-27,,

NCT06898853,The Effect of 0.1% Topical Ciclosporin A for 12-weeks on the Eye Surface Immune Cells in Dry Eyes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06898853,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a common, long-lasting condition that affects the surface of the eye. It happens when there's a problem with tear production or quality, which can lead to inflammation and discomfort. The immune system plays a big role in how DED develops and continues.

Researchers have found that in people with DED, there are more immune cells and inflammatory substances in the tears and on the eye's surface. This includes various types of immune cells, like T cells and dendritic cells, which are part of the body's defense system.

The first treatment for DED is usually artificial tears, but because the condition is chronic and can flare up, clinicians often use anti-inflammatory treatments too. One such treatment is cyclosporine A (CsA), which comes as eye drops. CsA works by reducing inflammation and affects how immune cells behave.

Researchers can study the immune cells on the eye's surface using a special microscopy technique called in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). A newer version of this method, called functional IVCM (Fun-IVCM), allows researchers to watch how these cells move and behave over time.

In the current study, researchers want to compare 0.1% CsA with a lubricating eye drop to see how they affect the immune cells on the eye's surface. The researchers will use Fun-IVCM to look at the number, shape, and movement of immune cells of the eye. The researchers will also collect samples from the eye's surface and tears to measure various markers of inflammation.

The goal is to better understand how CsA works in treating DED by directly observing its effects on the immune response in the eye, which is unexplored. This could help improve treatments for people suffering from this condition and expand the use of CsA in DED.",NO,Dry Eye Disease (DED),DRUG: 0.1% Ciclosporin A eye drops|DRUG: Mineral oils eye drops,"Corneal epithelial immune cell density, Evaluation of change in corneal epithelial immune cell density using in vivo confocal microscopy.

Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is one of the newest technologies whose input in CR is currently being investigated. It is a technology which helps simulate the real environment through a virtual one, allowing for interaction with the environment and to carry out exercise with variability, where intensity, repetition and feedback are key elements. It is reported that immersion in VR environments diverts the attention of the patient from unpleasant bodily sensations, thus delaying the onset of boredom and fatigue. This is reported to possibly incite higher participation. In addition, VR has some noticeable indirect benefits for postcardiac event patients. It is reported that when using head-mounted devices during stationary cycling, a reduction in sympathetic tone and thus increase blood flow to the muscles prolonging the exercise duration and enhancing fatigue resistance will result. The use of distraction therapy through VR, one which isolates the patients from the medical context and puts all the attention on the virtual experience, makes the patient be distracted from the unpleasant stimuli of the surrounding environment. Distraction therapy through VR is reported to provide positive emotions, reduce anxiety and lead to an underestimation of the treatment duration.",NO,Cardiac Disease|Coronary Artery Bypass,PROCEDURE: IVR using the Morpheus Programme|PROCEDURE: Cardiac Rehabilitation control group,"6 minute walk test, Exercise Tolerance test, Up to 6weeks|Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score, Measure for Anxiety and Depression, Up to 6weeks",,,University of Malta,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,Cardiac Rehab & VR,2024-09-01,2025-06-30,2025-06-30,2025-03-27,,2025-03-27,"Department of Physiotherapy Faculty of Health Sciences, Imsida, MSD2080, Malta",

Breathing problems are the most common reason for admission to our neonatal unit at the National Maternity Hospital. When a baby has serious breathing difficulty, inserting a breathing tube to place them on a ventilator can be lifesaving. A breathing tube must be placed through the vocal cords into the windpipe (trachea). A device called a laryngoscope is placed in a patients mouth to allow the doctor to see the vocal cords and insert the tube correctly.

The skill of placing this breathing tube (intubation) is important for doctors and specialists to learn so that they can confidently perform it in an emergency.

In the past, doctors had more opportunities during their training to learn and practice this with supervision from seniors. In recent years, babies, thankfully, need to be intubated less frequently and doctors working hours are better regulated. As a result, junior doctors have less chances to perform this skill. There is a need to improve how we teach the procedure of intubating babies to doctors in training to meet the needs of trainees today.

The investigators want to perform a study to help teach doctors in training how to perform intubation of a newborn using a video laryngoscope. The team are looking to assess if showing a short educational video to the doctor and team just before performing an intubation using a video laryngoscope will reduce the time the procedure takes. This is called a ""Just-in-Time"" video. The investigators aim to demonstrate a benefit by performing a randomised control trial. This means that when a baby requires intubation as decided by their treating doctors, the team will be randomly allocated to view a ""Just-in-Time"" video before performing the intubation or not.

Further, the investigators predict a fanning effect: some children with DLD will ""catch up"" to their TL peers in adulthood, some will show evidence of a decline, and others will show stable trajectories. In Aim 2, the investigators measure real-time competition across written and spoken language using eye-tracking. According to speed of processing accounts adults with DLD may be slower than their TL peers to activate competitors and targets.

NCT06898619,The Impact of Crisis Management Training on Disaster Nursing Competencies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06898619,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of crisis management training designed for third-year nursing students. Crisis management in the healthcare sector holds critical importance during unforeseen events such as natural disasters and emergencies. The ability of nurses to effectively plan, make quick decisions, and manage crises successfully plays a vital role in ensuring patient safety and operational efficiency. The primary objective of this research is to enhance nursing students' crisis management skills and to assess the extent to which these skills can be improved through targeted training.

The study employs a pre-test and post-test design. The participants will consist of third-year nursing students. A pre-test will be administered before the training to assess the participants' existing knowledge and skills in crisis management. The training content will focus on crisis management concepts, planning strategies, rapid decision-making processes, and team coordination. Additionally, intervention approaches to natural disasters such as earthquakes will be addressed in detail. At the conclusion of the training, a post-test will be conducted to evaluate the program's effectiveness.

The data collection process will utilize the Disaster Nursing Preparedness and Response Competency Scale, a standardized tool designed to measure students' levels of preparedness, problem-solving skills during crises, and intervention effectiveness. The training program will adopt an interactive approach, integrating both theoretical and practical components.

The study hypothesizes that crisis management training will significantly enhance the disaster nursing competencies of nursing students. The findings aim to reveal whether the training leads to a substantial improvement in the knowledge and skill levels of the participants.

The study is scheduled to be conducted at a private university in Istanbul in March 2025. The study population comprises all third-year nursing students enrolled in the nursing program at the university during the study period (N=70). No sampling method will be used, as the study aims to include the entire population. The training program will consist of a single session and will incorporate feedback from students and motivation-enhancing activities. Slavin's Effective Teaching Model will be employed, featuring presentations and interactive sessions. Data will be collected using a Personal Information Form and the Disaster Nursing Preparedness and Response Competency Scale.

The collected data will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows 22.0. The normality of data distribution will be assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. If the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test indicates p\>0.05p \> 0.05p\>0.05, the data will be considered normally distributed. Conversely, if p\<0.05p \< 0.05p\<0.05, the data will be deemed non-normally distributed, and skewness and kurtosis values will be examined. Changes in repeated measurements will be analyzed using a Repeated Measures ANOVA if the data is normally distributed, or the Friedman Test if it is not.

Descriptive statistics will be employed to summarize the general characteristics of the data, including the means and distributions of pre-test and post-test scores. To evaluate the impact of the training program, a Paired Samples T-Test will be conducted to assess the differences between pre-test and post-test scores within the same group. This analysis will measure the program's effects on time management and procrastination behaviors. Additionally, effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d) will be calculated to evaluate the magnitude and significance of the intervention's effects.

Despite advances in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of depression, many patients do not adequately respond to conventional treatment with antidepressants and psychotherapy, with 30% of patients considered treatment-resistant. In this context, research on new therapeutic approaches is crucial to improve depression treatment. Psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic substance found in mushrooms of the genus Psilocybe, has shown promising results for the treatment of various mental disorders, including depression. However, in general, withdrawal from serotonergic antidepressant drugs is a common prerequisite for participation in clinical studies with psilocybin, due to a supposed possibility of antidepressant drugs altering the psychedelic effect. This study aims to investigate whether there are differences in the psychedelic, antidepressant, and adverse effects of concurrent or non-concurrent administration of Psilocybe mushrooms with daily fluoxetine, a serotonergic antidepressant. For this purpose, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted, dividing participants into two groups: an intervention group, which will receive fluoxetine treatment combined with a session of psychotherapy assisted by a single dose of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms equivalent to 30mg of psilocybin, and a control group, which will receive the same treatment with mushrooms but will use daily placebo instead of fluoxetine. The severity of depressive symptoms will be evaluated over 6 weeks primarily through the MADRS scale. It is expected that both groups will maintain the same pattern of psychedelic experience and present the same antidepressant results, demonstrating that there is no attenuation of effects by fluoxetine.

NCT06898554,Spinal and Supraspinal Control in Chronic Ankle Instability,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06898554,,RECRUITING,"Ankle sprains are common sports injuries that often lead to chronic ankle instability (CAI). Patients with CAI experience deficits in neuromuscular control (NMC), including proprioception and strength. It is believed that damage to the ankle's ligament mechanoreceptors and the peroneal nerve after the initial ankle sprain can cause alterations in NMC, resulting in postural control and dynamic joint stability dysfunction. Inflammation related to recurrent ankle sprains may also contribute to neuromuscular impairments. Evidence suggests that bilateral postural control deficits occur after an ankle sprain, suggesting alterations in the central nervous system (CNS). Rehabilitation for CAI has been shown to lead to bilateral improvements in NMC, potentially due to neural alterations at both the spinal and supraspinal levels. Cross-education, which refers to the muscular crossed effect of unilateral training, has also been proposed as a mechanism for improving contralateral strength in neurologically healthy individuals. While the exact mechanisms underlying cross-education are not yet fully understood, evidence suggests that it involves neural adaptations at both spinal and supraspinal levels.

NCT06898372,Evaluate the Efficacy of Anti-Jak1 Inhibitors as Treatment for Patients With Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06898372,,COMPLETED,"Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) is a hereditary multisystem autoinflammatory disorder that predominantly affects the central nervous system. It is characterized by severe neurological disability and chronic inflammation caused by the persistent overproduction of type I interferon. To date, nine causative genes of AGS have been identified, each of which can lead to classic AGS presentations, atypical forms, or other manifestations that do not meet the formal diagnostic criteria for AGS and are referred to as ""AGS-related interferonopathies."" Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitors, including Baricitinib and Ruxolitinib, offer a promising therapeutic strategy for Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) by directly targeting the central pathogenic pathway of the disease.

Patients treated with JAK1 inhibitors for AGS have shown significant improvement in systemic symptoms, though the effect on neurological symptoms and brain imaging remains unclear.

The aim of this project is to retrospectively analyze the efficacy, particularly on neurological symptoms and brain imaging, and the safety of JAK1 inhibitor treatment in AGS patients treated at Italian tertiary centers. Data will be collected before starting the therapy and during follow-up at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, where available.

Preliminary data collection was carried out through a survey conducted by the AGS Italy group to assess the number of patients treated with JAK1 inhibitors.

Clinical, brain imaging, genetic, and laboratory data routinely recorded in nine different Italian centers as part of the standard clinical care of these patients will be retrospectively collected and analyzed.

In the second phase of the study, brain MRI data from AGS patients treated with JAK1 inhibitors will be compared to untreated AGS patients matched for age and genotype, in order to evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of JAK1 inhibitors on brain imaging compared to the natural clinical progression of the disease.

NCT06898242,Early Myofascial Manual Treatment in Subjects With Spasticity Following Acquired Brain Injury,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06898242,MyosABI,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Spasticity is characterized by an increase in muscle tone that is velocity-dependent and caused by the exaggeration of the stretch reflex. Clinically, it is found in 70-85% of patients with spinal cord injury at one year, 40-45% in patients with stroke at 12 months, and 25% in patients with traumatic brain injury at one year.

The term 'Severe Acquired Brain Injury' refers to a condition characterized by brain damage that causes a coma with an acute phase score of 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), lasting more than 24 hours. It may be caused by vascular, traumatic, anoxic, infectious, toxic-metabolic, or neoplastic damage, which can cause multiple and complex sensory, cognitive, and behavioral impairments that lead to significant disability. Spasticity occurs frequently in patients with GCA, often at an early stage, with serious repercussions on the rehabilitation process and outcome.

Numerous studies indicate that spasticity due to neurological damage is supported, in addition to hyperexcitable stretch reflexes, by changes in the connective tissues of the peripheral limbs that increase muscle resistance to passive movement. After neurological damage, and starting 1 week after immobilization, alterations in the muscles and connective tissue can be observed: changes in the muscle fibers, changes in the collagen tissue, and changes in the properties of the tendons. It is believed that the quantitative and qualitative changes in the intramuscular connective tissue contribute to the deterioration of the properties and functions of the immobilized muscle, which contributes to the establishment and progression of spasticity.

In patients with spastic paresis, therapeutic interventions are intended to prevent prolonged shortening of the muscles and mobilize the affected areas. According to recent research, the connective tissue is particularly sensitive to mechanical stress, particularly deep manual manipulation and vibration. Several studies have suggested that myofascial release therapy can be a complementary treatment in patients with neurological disorders to reduce muscle spasticity and increase joint mobility.

Myofascial release techniques can be hypothesized to be a valid integrated treatment for spasticity in patients with sequelae from GCA, but their use in this area has been little studied and no studies have been conducted in the post-acute period of intensive hospitalization.

The purpose of the present study is to determine whether manual myofascial release techniques, applied to the upper and lower limbs, are safe, tolerable, and effective in modifying the degree of spasticity and improving functional activity in patients with GCA. Additionally, changes in muscle structure will be evaluated by ultrasound: cross-sectional area, anteroposterior diameter, and pennation angle.

Finally, we will measure the effects of manual myofascial treatment stimulation by measuring electrodermal activity (EDA), which is a non-invasive method in which an electrode bracelet is applied to the patient's right wrist to measure the electrical conductance of the skin, which is a function of the autonomic nervous system, which is controlled by the sweat glands. Various sensory stimulations, including visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, vestibular, and proprioceptive stimulations, can produce a physical sensation that can influence the patient's sensorimotor output, resulting in physiological changes in the activity of the ANS as a consequence of the processing of sensory afferents. A response to an appropriate sensory stimulus can be regarded as a manifestation of a change in consciousness.",NO,"Brain Injury|Brain Injury, Vascular|Brain Injuries, Traumatic",OTHER: Manual myofascial treatment direct to upper and lower limb|OTHER: Rehabilitative treatment following rehabilitation project,"Modification of spasticity through Modified Ashworth Scale, Evaluation of changes in the degree of spasticity of upper and lower limbs through Modified Ashworth Scale (lower degree 0: no increase in muscle tone; maximum degree 4: affected part rigid in flexion or extension), Changes from baseline (T0), 4 weeks of treatment (T1), 4 weeks of follow up (T2)","Tolerance and safety of treatment, Evaluation of safety and tolerability of treatment throught Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia scale (minimum degree 0: no pain; maximum degree 10: maximum pain), Changes from baseline (T0), 4 weeks of treatment (T1), 4 weeks of follow up (T2)|Evaluation of changes in the degree of functional use of the upper and lower limbs through Motricity Index Scale, Motricity Index Scale: minimum degree 0: no movement; maximum degree: movement performed with normal force, Changes from baseline (T0), 4 weeks of treatment (T1), 4 weeks of follow up (T2)","Changes in muscle echostructure, Evaluation in muscle echostructure through assessment of cross sectional area (Unit of Measure: cm\^2) at medial gemellus muscle and biceps brachii muscle., Changes from baseline (T0), 4 weeks of treatment (T1), 4 weeks of follow up (T2)|Changes in muscle echostructure, Evaluation of muscle echostructure through assessment of anterior-posterior diameter (unit of measure: mm) at medial gemellus muscle and biceps brachii muscle., Changes from baseline (T0), 4 weeks of treatment (T1), 4 weeks of follow up (T2)|Changes in muscle echostructure, Evaluation of muscle echostructure through assessment of Heckmatt Index at medial gemellus muscle and biceps brachii muscle (unit of measure: prime numbers from 1 to 4; 1: normal aspect of muscle echostructure, clear bone echo; 4: high echointensity of muscle, absent bone echo), Changes from baseline (T0), 4 weeks of treatment (T1), 4 weeks of follow up (T2)|Changes in muscle echostructure, Evaluation of muscle echostructure through assessment of pennation angle at medial gemellus muscle and biceps brachii muscle (unit of measure: degrees), Changes from baseline (T0), 4 weeks of treatment (T1), 4 weeks of follow up (T2)|Evaluation of electrodermal activity, Evaluation of modification of skin conductance through assessment of modification of electrodermal activity (unit of measure: prime numbers), Changes from baseline (T0), 4 weeks of treatment (T1), 4 weeks of follow-up (T2)",Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,24,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,6661,2025-03-13,2025-09-24,2026-03-24,2025-03-27,,2025-04-02,"UOC Neuroriabilitazione ad Alta Intensità COD. 75 Policlinico Gemelli, Roma, RM, 00168, Italy",

NCT06898203,Precision Imaging to Evaluate Kaposi Sarcoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06898203,PRIME-KS,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"AIM 1:

In Uganda and Kenya, Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. However, tracking how well patients are responding to treatment is challenging, especially in busy clinics. Doctors must measure the size and changes in the areas affected by the cancer by hand, which can take a lot of time and can vary depending on the doctor. This method does not work well for patients with dark skin, which can lead to biases in treatment compared to patients with fairer skin.

To solve this problem, the investigators suggest the use of a simple, low-cost device that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), the SkinScan3D (SS3D) device, to measure the cancer spots accurately and monitor changes over time. The goal of this study is to improve the SkinScan3D (SS3D) tool and the how it is used. The investigators will do this by talking to healthcare workers and patients, giving them surveys, and holding design workshops. The feedback from these activities will be shared with the device maker and local research teams to make the device better and ensure it is used properly.

AIMS 2 \& 3:

In this study the investigators seek to formally compare reproducibility and accuracy of KS lesion size measurements between SkinScan3D and the current standard of care manual measurement method.

The recommended treatment for severe aortic stenosis is a procedure called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Currently, before TAVI, doctors usually perform a coronary angiography to check if the blood vessels supplying the heart (the coronary arteries) are clear and free of blockages and to determine the right size of valve. If blockages are found, they are treated before or during TAVI. However, many patients who need TAVI are older and may have cardiovascular comorbidities, which means that they have other conditions that coexist with their cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or obesity. This increases the risk of complications due to coronary angiography. These risks include kidney problems from the contrast dye used in the test, bleeding, or complications at the access site where the procedure is done.

This study aims to evaluate whether a TAVI pathway procedure without prior coronary angiography is non-inferior to a standard TAVI pathway procedure in which routine coronary angiography with or without revascularization is included, in patients with significant aortic stenosis who do not experience typical chest pain or discomfort that occurs when a part of your heart doesn't get enough blood and oxygen, classified as CCS 3 or higher. ""Non-inferior"" means that the aim of the study is to demonstrate that the TAVI pathway procedure without prior coronary angiography is at least as effective as the standard TAVI pathway procedure with routine coronary angiography with or without revascularization. In both groups, the CE-certified Myval™ transcatheter heart valve series will be used. The Myval™ transcatheter heart valve series device is commercially available. This valve is designed to expand with a balloon and allows for a precise fit and good performance.

NCT06897995,Aerobic Exercise on Platelet Mitochondrial Function,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06897995,,COMPLETED,"This study explores how exercise affects blood platelets and their role in clotting. Regular exercise can influence how efficiently clots form in the body. Intense exercise tends to increase platelet activity and the expression of certain molecules on their surface, while moderate exercise can decrease this activity. Since platelets are responsible for blood clotting, understanding how they function can be crucial.

Understanding Platelets:

Platelets are blood cells that help in clotting. The mitochondria within platelets help regulate their function. If these mitochondria don't work properly, it can lead to issues with clotting. By examining how exercise changes platelet mitochondria, the investigators can potentially identify important markers for health and disease progression.

Study Design:

This study compares two types of exercise routines: circuit training and stationary bicycle training.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups:

Circuit Training Group: This involves moving through different exercise stations within a set time, targeting various body parts. It's tailored for those who might find regular exercise challenging, helping to reduce fatigue in any single area and improve overall fitness.

Bicycle Training Group: This involves exercising on a stationary bike. Both exercise groups will engage in high-intensity interval training for about 40 minutes, five times a week, over six weeks.

Assessment: Participants will undergo tests to measure endurance and physical function.

Blood Sampling: Blood will be drawn before and after the exercise tests, with 20 milliliters taken from the arm vein. Blood samples will also be collected at the start and end of a 6-week intervention, totaling 80 milliliters throughout the study. This helps the investigators analyze how platelets are affected by exercise.

This study is designed to help the investigators better understand how different types of exercise can benefit platelet function and overall health. Participanting in this research could contribute to the knowledge about how could exercise influence blood clotting and related health conditions. Participants' involvement will include exercise routines or maintaining your current lifestyle, along with simple blood tests.

NCT06897787,Effect of Proximal Segment Positioning on Postoperative Condylar Remodeling in Bimaxillary Orthognathic Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06897787,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Bimaxillary orthognathic surgery is a surgical procedure that involves simultaneous corrections to both the maxilla (upper jaw) and mandible (lower jaw). This surgery is performed to correct facial and jaw deformities, improve occlusion, and enhance facial symmetry. The need for orthognathic surgery typically arises in cases where there is a significant discrepancy between the upper and lower jaws or severe malocclusion.

In bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, following mandibular osteotomies, the lower jaw is divided into two segments: the distal segment, which contains the teeth, and the proximal segment, which includes the condylar head. While the distal segment is positioned according to the ideal occlusion planned in collaboration with orthodontists using digital design, the management of the proximal segment varies among surgeons. Some surgeons leave the proximal segment in its original position without mobilization, whereas others reposition it through rotational movements.

This study aims to evaluate condylar remodeling by comparing these two surgical approaches in patients divided into two groups, assessing how each technique affects postoperative outcomes.",NO,Dentofacial Deformities|Dentofacial Anomalies [Including Malocclusion] and Other Disorders of Jaw (M26-M27),PROCEDURE: manuel positioning group|PROCEDURE: mandibular basis osteotomy,"mandibular condyle position superimposition, During bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, proximal segment positioning devices will be used in both groups to ensure that the condylar position remains at the location determined during virtual surgical planning.

NCT06897722,"Evaluation of TNF-α, IL-17A, and YKL-40 in GCF and Serum of Psoriasis Patients and Healthy Controls",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06897722,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Background:

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects 2-3% of the global population and is linked to immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation. Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory gum disease, leads to the destruction of gum tissues and bone. Both conditions share common inflammatory pathways, with key immune mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-17A (IL-17A), and YKL-40 playing a role in tissue destruction and disease progression. However, the biological mechanisms linking psoriasis and periodontitis remain unclear, and few studies have examined localized inflammatory responses in the gums of psoriasis patients.

Objectives and Methods:

This study aims to evaluate the relationship between psoriasis and periodontitis by measuring TNF-α, IL-17A, and YKL-40 levels in both gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and serum. A total of 100 participants will be recruited and categorized into three groups:

Control (C): Healthy individuals without psoriasis or periodontitis. Gingivitis (G): Individuals diagnosed with gingivitis but without psoriasis. Periodontitis (P): Individuals diagnosed with periodontitis but without psoriasis.

Psoriasis with gingivitis (PS+G): Individuals diagnosed with gingivitis but without psoriasis.

Psoriasis with Periodontitis (PS+P): Individuals with both psoriasis and periodontitis.

All participants will undergo periodontal examinations, including plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). GCF and blood samples will be collected, and biomarker levels will be analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Expected Outcomes and Clinical Relevance:

The study will investigate whether systemic inflammation in psoriasis contributes to periodontal disease progression. If psoriasis patients show higher inflammatory biomarker levels, it may suggest a shared immunopathogenic mechanism.

The results may contribute to:

Early detection strategies for periodontitis in psoriasis patients. Targeted anti-inflammatory therapies for both conditions. Interdisciplinary collaboration between dermatologists and periodontists for better management.

This study is the first to evaluate TNF-α and YKL-40 in the GCF of psoriasis patients, filling a critical gap in the literature regarding localized immune responses. The results could also help identify potential biomarkers that may be useful for monitoring disease progression and treatment responses in psoriasis and periodontitis patients.

Conclusion:

By investigating the inflammatory relationship between psoriasis and periodontitis, this study aims to uncover new insights into the immune system's role in chronic inflammatory diseases. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to improved diagnostic tools, prevention strategies, and personalized treatment approaches for patients affected by both conditions.",NO,Psoriasis (PsO)|Periodontal Disease,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: TNF-α analysis in GCF|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: IL-17A analysis in GCF|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: YKL-40 analysis in GCF|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: TNF-α analysis in Serum|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: İL-17A analysis in Serum|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: YKL-40 analysis in Serum|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Periodontal assesment,"TNF-α levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), Levels of TNF-α will be measured using ELISA in GCF samples collected at baseline., At baseline (single visit)|TNF-α levels in serum, Levels of TNF-α will be measured using ELISA in serum samples collected at baseline., At baseline (single visit).|IL-17A levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), Levels of İL-17A will be measured using ELISA in serum samples collected at baseline., At baseline (single visit).|IL-17A levels in serum, Levels of IL-17A will be measured using ELISA in GCF samples collected at baseline., At baseline (single visit).|YKL-40 levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), Levels of YKL-40 will be measured using ELISA in GCF samples collected at baseline., At baseline (single visit).|YKL-40 levels in serum, Levels of TNF-α will be measured using ELISA in serum samples collected at baseline., At baseline (single visit).|Periodontal assesment, Probing Pocket Depth (PPD), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL), Bleeding on Probing (BOP), Plaque Index (PI) collected at baseline., At baseline (single visit)",,,Zhala Vatankha Sain,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,100,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,AkdenizU Organization,2024-11-04,2025-03-03,2025-04,2025-03-27,,2025-03-27,"Akdeniz University Faculty of Dentistry, Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya, 07070, Turkey",

In the United States, adult Hispanic males are particularly vulnerable to type 2 diabetes mellitus and are more likely to develop complications and subsequently die from it, compared to non-Hispanic White males. Evidence suggests good self-management behaviors can potentially prevent disease-related complications and improve clinical outcomes. The American Diabetes Association and Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists have endorsed diabetes self-management education as a necessary component of care for all individuals living with the disease. However, adult Hispanic males with type 2 diabetes mellitus living in the Middle Atlantic Region of the U.S., especially those who are underserved, typically lack access to formal diabetes self-management education (DSME). Further, the majority have never participated in such educational activities (Au et al., 2021; New Jersey Department of Health, 2013; 2017; 2023).

NCT06897176,"Effects of Cerebrolysin on Language Ability in Non-fluent Aphasia Patients After Stroke: A Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blinded, Single Center Study",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06897176,,RECRUITING,""" This study aims to measure changes in language ability after adding cerebrolysin to standard treatment for non-fluent aphasia patients with post-stroke language impairment. The patients are divided into two groups: the experimental group, which receives a combination of standard treatment (speech therapy) and cerebrolysin, and the control group, which only receives standard treatment (speech therapy). By comparing the PK-WAB scores before and after drug administration, the study seeks to analyze the impact of cerebrolysin on language improvement. According to various stroke registries, 15-42% of patients in the subacute phase of stroke and 25-50% of patients with chronic stroke show symptoms of aphasia. Language therapy for stroke-related aphasia has become increasingly important due to its association with prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare costs, mortality, and other negative prognostic factors .

After central nervous system damage such as stroke and traumatic brain injury, the administration of growth hormones and neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been reported to influence nerve regeneration.

Cerebrolysin (EVER Neuro Pharma GmbH, AUSTRIA) is a multi-modal drug composed of low-molecular peptides and amino acids, which shows neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects similar to endogenous neurotrophic factors. Analysis of cerebrolysin using ELISA revealed that it contains CNTF, GDNF, IGF1, IGF2, and other factors structurally and functionally similar to neurotrophic factors (NTFs). Cerebrolysin activates the same PI3K/Akt pathway as BDNF, playing a crucial role in the growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of nerve cells, and promoting the maintenance, protection, and repair of neural networks. Additionally, it activates the SHH pathway, facilitating neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, thereby aiding the brain's self-repair process and functional recovery. Recent studies have shown that cerebrolysin reduces inflammation in the cerebral vasculature and improves the integrity of the blood-brain barrier by increasing tight junctions.

Cerebrolysin has shown excellent effects on motor function improvement in moderate-to-severe stroke patients in studies by Muresanu et al. 2016. and Chang et al. 2016. Based on these results, cerebrolysin has been included in stroke rehabilitation guidelines in Austria (2018), Germany (2020), Canada (2020), the European Neuroscience Society (2021), and the Korean Brain and Neurorehabilitation Society (2022). Furthermore, cerebrolysin has been included in the Canadian TBI guidelines for improving attention in patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury, and it is expected to be beneficial in the rehabilitation of both stroke and traumatic brain injury patients.

Although there is strong evidence that cerebrolysin improves motor function, attention, and consciousness levels after stroke or brain injury, its effect on language abilities remains unclear. Moreover, previous studies have limitations, including the use of the Western Aphasia Battery Test and heterogeneity in language assessments. Therefore, this study plans to conduct additional research using a well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to assess the effect of cerebrolysin on non-fluent aphasia, using a variety of evaluation tools to accurately measure improvements in language abilities.""",NO,Stroke,DRUG: Cerebrolyisin|DRUG: Placebo,"Paradise Korean Western Aphasia Battery (PK-WAB), It is a test used to evaluate the communication function of patients who have developed acquired neurological disorders, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and dementia.

Turkey is located on active fault lines, and a significant portion of its population is at risk of earthquakes. Therefore, earthquake preparedness is critically important for public health.

Nursing students, as future healthcare professionals, must be prepared for disasters. Earthquake preparedness and awareness training enable students to act consciously before, during, and after an earthquake, contributing to their effective participation in disaster management. These training programs enhance earthquake literacy, supporting quick and accurate decision-making in high-risk situations.

This study is designed as a non-randomized, pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study. Data will be collected using the Socio-Demographic Characteristics Form, ""Individuals' Knowledge Scale on Readiness Levels Before and During Earthquakes, Individuals' Behavior Scale on Readiness Levels Before and During Earthquakes, Earthquake Literacy Scale, and Attitudes Toward Earthquake Scale."" Assessments will be conducted before the intervention and again at the end of a 12-week period following the intervention.

This study aims to comprehensively examine the impact of earthquake preparedness and awareness training on nursing students studying in a high-risk seismic zone in Turkey. Specifically, it will evaluate the students' readiness levels before and during an earthquake, their earthquake literacy, and their attitudes toward earthquakes.

NCT06896942,Autism Doula Program Evaluation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06896942,,RECRUITING,"Background: Findings from a group level assessment with caregivers of Black children with autism revealed barriers to equitable care and services (e.g., a lack of cultural representation among their child's care team, caregiver stress, stigma, and uncertainty about services needed). The Autism Doula program was identified by the community to address the aforementioned barriers and provide culturally matched family navigation and social-emotional support while also acknowledging the unique experiences and values of caregivers of Black children with autism.

Impact: The current project aims to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of the Autism Doula program and promote equitable care for Black children with autism and their families.

Methods: Fifty-six Black families of children 18 months to five years of age who recently received a new diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder from CCHMC will be recruited to the current study. Twenty-six families will be randomly assigned to either the control group (i.e., care as usual including DDBP Family Navigation) or the intervention group (i.e., Autism Doula services). Feasibility and acceptability data will be gathered, including satisfaction of both groups, how many families approached agree to be in the study, how many sessions with the doula were successfully completed, and was the intervention content delivered as intended. Additionally, preliminary effectiveness will be evaluated by examining completion of recommended next steps, caregivers' perceived stress, and self-efficacy.

Implications: Data from this project will provide evidence that the Autism Doula program is feasible, acceptable, and effective, ultimately demonstrating it as an equitable care approach for Black children with autism and their families.

Traditional conservative treatments include physical therapy and lifestyle modifications. The digital revolution in healthcare has introduced app-based interventions as a promising alternative.

Rationale: Given the high burden of spinal complaints and the associated economic impact, there is need for effective and efficient treatment modalities. This is especially evident in Western healthcare systems with growing demands and limited resources due to the changing demographic of the population. An app-based approach offers a viable solution by combining evidence-based conservative treatments. Moreover, an app-based treatment could offer personalized treatment, real-time feedback, and enhanced patient engagement at lower costs, presents as a viable solution.

Objective: This pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an app-based treatment method combining physical exercise, graded activity, and pain journaling for patients with spinal complaints who will otherwise receive physical therapy, general lifestyle advice, or an expectant treatment in current practice.

Study design: Single center prospective study.

Study population: A total of 30 patients over 18 years old suffering from spinal complaints for which in current practice physical therapy, general lifestyle advice, or an expectant treatment will be advised.

Intervention: An app-based treatment consisting of a combination of physical exercise, graded activity, and pain journaling.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint: Patients' experience and satisfaction qualitatively, measured using semi-structured face-to-face interviews after three months of treatment.

Secondary endpoints: Quality of Life (Qol) measured with the EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) at baseline, one, two and three months after starting the intervention. Change in back- and leg-pain, measured with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Change in disability, measured with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Change in catastrophizing of pain, measured with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Change in lost productivity, measured with patient reported missed working days. Healthcare consumption, measured with number of visits to doctor or paramedic. Change in Body Mass Index, measured using patients' input on length and weight. Adherence of participants measured using frequency of patients' input in the mobile application. Safety measured using the (serious) adverse events ((S)AE).

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The nature and extent of the burden associated with participation in the app-based treatment program primarily involve adherence to recommended activities and inputting relevant health data. Given that the investigators are integrating existing treatment modalities, such as physical exercise, graded activity, and pain journaling, the risks associated with participation are minimal, as these interventions are already deemed safe and widely practiced. The responsibility for determining each patient's suitability for participation in this study lies with the referring physician.

Brief Summary:

The goal of this clinical trial is to learn whether the Sodium Management Tool (SMT) can improve patients clnical outcomes.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

Does the SMT help reduce weight gain between dialysis sessions? Does the SMT improve dialysis tolerance by reducing symptoms like low blood pressure and muscle cramps?

Researchers will compare standard dialysis to dialysis using the SMT to see if clinical outcomes are better in dialysis that use the SMT.

Participants will:

Receive dialysis three times per week with either standard dialysis or SMT-activated dialysis Switch between standard dialysis and SMT-activated dialysis after 4 weeks Have their blood pressure, sodium levels, and symptoms monitored during treatment Report their symptoms and thirst levels in a questionnaire Some participants may continue for an additional 4 weeks with a personalized SMT setting based on their symptoms and weight changes.

The investigators hypothesize that: (1) adverse changes in the myocardium may occur during exercise in acute normobaric hypoxia, but they are at least partially reversed by adaptive alterations induced by training in hypoxia; (2) this response is identical in athletes with eccentric cardiac hypertrophy and those with concentric cardiac hypertrophy.

The study consists of three stages. Stage 1 (completed) has examine changes in the blood levels of cardiac biomarkers in response to a single bout of exercise performed until volitional exhaustion in normoxia and during different levels of hypoxia (2000, 3000m). This stage has examined men aged 20-40 years involved in competitive cycling and triathlon, and untrained, healthy men.

Stage 2 of the study will examine changes in the blood levels of cardiac biomarkers in cyclists (aged 20-40) in response to a 3-week endurance training in hypoxia and to passive prolonged exposure (11 to 12 hours a day) to a simulated altitude of 3000m. Stage 3 will examine changes in blood levels of cardiac biomarkers in response to a 3-week resistance training in hypoxia (3000m). This stage of the study will involve men aged 20-40 training in strength sports.

The project will help clarify the effects of hypoxia on the physiological state of the heart in athletes with eccentric or concentric cardiac hypertrophy, as well as determine the differences between competitive athletes vs. untrained, healthy men in the response to hypoxia. The findings may be used in planning and controlling the training process in both strength and endurance disciplines.

Nasal administration of dexmedetomidine is a convenient and non - invasive sedation technique for children. This technique can reduce the incidences of pre - operative anxiety and emergence agitation. However, there are few studies on the effect of dexmedetomidine on intraoperative electroencephalographic activities.

In view of this, the investigators elaborately designed a prospective, multi - center, large - sample - sized, double - blind, randomized - controlled clinical trial. This trial aims to provide a basis for drug selection in pediatric anesthesia, ensuring the safety and comfort of pediatric anesthesia.

The investigators plan to select 627 participants who will undergo minor surgeries under general anesthesia. Thirty minutes before the surgery, dexmedetomidine or normal saline will be administered nasally to these participants. Before the surgery, the anxiety degree and sedation score of the participants will be assessed; during the surgery, the cooperation degree of patients during anesthesia induction will be evaluated and electroencephalographic monitoring will be carried out; after the surgery, the incidence of emergence agitation, the recovery time and the analgesic score of the participants will be assessed.

NCT06896669,Effects of Vitamin D and Calcium on Hyperglycemia and Dyslipidemia in Patients Gestational Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06896669,,RECRUITING,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is becoming more common globally as a metabolic disease that occurs during pregnancy and influences the mother and the fetus. It has been linked to preeclampsia, C-section, and a higher lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes both for mother and the child. Another complication of GDM is dyslipidemia that also accentuates cardiovascular risks, so the care of lipid profiles is essential for the best pregnancy outcomes. The previous literature review indicates that micronutrients including vitamin D and calcium have a bearing on glucose and lipid profiles. Various studies have established that vitamin D improves the insulin response and lipid profile whereas calcium is vital in insulin and glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, it is revealed that calcium induces vitamin D so that it could undergo its full metabolic effect. Hence, the addition of vitamin D and calcium together may enhance glycemic management and lipid profiles of GDM patients. The aim of the present work is to compare the impact of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on lipid profiles and hyperglycemia in GDM patients. It will measure the major metabolic indices fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipid profile (LDL, HDL triglycerides) and review the effect of this on pregnancy outcomes.

Why Is This Study Important? Immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment, but not all patients respond well. Research suggests that diet, particularly a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, may help boost the immune system and make treatments more effective.

What Will This Study Examine?

Researchers want to understand:

Is the ketogenic diet well-tolerated for cancer patients? Does the diet improve immune responses and treatment effectiveness?

How Will the Study Work?

Participants will be placed into one of two groups:

Ketogenic Diet (KD) Group: A structured high-fat, low-carb diet (intermittent schedule: 2 weeks on, 1 week off).

Standard Diet (SD) Group: A typical diet with no major changes. Throughout the study, a dietitian will closely support and guide you. Both groups will continue their standard immunotherapy treatment.

What Will Participants Do? Write their food intake three times a week to help assess dietary adherence Follow their assigned diet for 10 weeks Have weekly check-ins with a dietitian (in-person at the hospital or via phone) Have weekly blood glucose and ketone level checks using a home device. Provide monthly blood samples to measure immune response during routine immunotherapy infusions Provide stool samples for gut microbiome analysis at the start and end of the study Measure Monthly Weight, body composition, and resting calorie burn Complete quality-of-life questionnaires

What Are the Potential Benefits? Improved response to immunotherapy Better understanding of how diet influences cancer treatment Potential for a new supportive strategy for cancer care

NCT06896539,Telemedicine for Contraceptive Counselling- An Open Randomized Controlled Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06896539,Tele-prev,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Protocol Summary:

Sweden has high unintended pregnancy rates, increasing unmet contraceptive needs, and the highest repeat abortion rate in the European Union. Effective contraceptive counseling can improve satisfaction, empower correct use, and increase uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), potentially reducing unintended pregnancies.

Research has explored ways to enhance contraceptive counseling, focusing on increasing LARC use. Interventions that improve access, remove financial barriers, and enhance method-specific knowledge-especially regarding effectiveness-have led to higher LARC adoption and fewer unintended pregnancies and abortions.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased tele-health use for contraceptive counseling. Studies suggest tele-health expands appointment availability, reduces geographic barriers, and improves access to reproductive care, particularly in low-resource populations. However, few studies have examined tele-health's impact on contraceptive counseling, uptake, and satisfaction compared to in-person visits, particularly in Sweden. Before tele-health can be established as a viable family planning option, its counseling quality and impact on LARC adoption must be assessed.

Study Aims:

To determine whether the choice of LARC after tele-health (video) counseling is comparable to in-person counseling with a midwife, using structured contraceptive counseling in both groups.

To assess whether LARC uptake three months post-counseling is similar between women who received tele-health vs. in-person counseling.

NCT06896513,Relationship of Isthmus Thickness with Difficult Laryngoscopy and Difficult Intubation in Patients Receiving Hypothyroidism Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06896513,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Under general anesthesia, the rate of failed intubation ranges from 1.5% to 13%, raising concerns among anesthesiologists whose primary goal is successful airway management. In this context, various physical and ultrasonographic measurement techniques have been developed to predict difficult intubation. Ultrasonography is effectively used for estimating tracheal tube size, device placement, diagnosing upper airway pathologies, and guiding percutaneous tracheostomy. In thyroid pathologies, intubation difficulty may increase; however, the impact of goiter remains debatable, as some conditions causing hypothyroidism are reported to lead to thyroid gland atrophy rather than hypertrophy. The study's hypothesis is that an atrophic or fibrotic thyroid isthmus may be associated with difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Evaluation will be performed using the Cormack-Lehane score (Grade III-IV) and the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS \>5). The aim is to determine the relationship between thyroid isthmus thickness and difficult laryngoscopy and intubation during elective intubation in patients receiving hypothyroidism treatment.

Preoperatively, patients' demographic and clinical data (age, gender, height, weight, BMI, comorbidities, ASA score, thyroid medication dose, treatment duration, and type of thyroid disease) will be recorded. In the premedication room, after administering 0.01 mg/kg IV midazolam, the distance between the thyroid isthmus and the skin will be measured using a linear ultrasound probe (3-13 Hz) in the supine position with neck hyperextension at the level of the 2nd-3rd tracheal rings; the average of three measurements will be recorded. In the operating room, under noninvasive monitoring and following mask pre-oxygenation, anesthesia induction will be performed using IV 2 mg/kg propofol, 1 µg/kg fentanyl, 1 mg/kg lidocaine, and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Once the TOF reaches zero, an experienced anesthesiologist will intubate using a size 3 Macintosh blade for females and size 4 for males with an appropriate endotracheal tube. The intubation time, defined as the interval from laryngoscope insertion until the first capnography wave is detected, will be recorded along with the Cormack-Lehane and EZS scores and the requirement for video laryngoscopy.

Brief Summary:

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Kegel exercises in reducing vaginal flatus among postpartum women. Vaginal flatus, the involuntary passage of air through the vagina, is a common but often underreported pelvic floor dysfunction that can affect women's quality of life.

A total of 40 postpartum women were randomly assigned to an experimental group (performing Kegel exercises) or a control group (no intervention). The experimental group performed Kegel exercises three times daily in different positions for six weeks. Vaginal flatus frequency and bother scores were assessed using a validated questionnaire, and sexual quality of life was evaluated with the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12).",NO,Pelvic Floor Awareness|Postpartum|Postpartum Pelvic Floor Function and Symptoms|Flatus,BEHAVIORAL: Kegel Exercises,"Vaginal Flatus Frequency Reduction, The primary outcome is the change in vaginal flatus frequency, assessed via patient-reported questionnaire before and after the intervention.

According to the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study, when evaluated in terms of burden of disease, life expectancy with disability and rehabilitation needs, low back and neck pain are at the top of this category. According to the Health Research Report published by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) in 2019, musculoskeletal disorders in the neck region are more common in women and were determined as the musculoskeletal disorder with the highest increase by 12.9% between 2016 and 2019.

It has been reported that in approximately half of individuals with neck pain, this pain recurs and becomes chronic. Factors such as sedentary lifestyle, history of low back pain, being female, anxiety disorders, sleep problems and smoking are thought to contribute to the chronicization of pain. Chronic neck pain is defined as pain in the neck region lasting longer than twelve weeks.

Cervical muscle activations have been monitored with EMG studies in the patient population with neck pain from past to present and altered cervical muscle activations have been reported in individuals with neck pain. The main muscle groups in which muscle activation has been monitored with superficial EMG and changes have been found in individuals with neck pain are upper trapezius, sternocelidomastoid, cervical erector spinal muscles and thoracic erector spinal muscles. On the other hand, it is still debated whether these muscle activation changes are the cause or a normal consequence of chronic neck pain.

In recent years, it has been reported in the literature that EMG Biofeedback studies have been included in patients with neck pain, but more studies are needed to determine its superiority to conventional applications. In the light of this information, in our study titled ""The Effect of Superficial EMG Biofeedback Training on Muscle Activation, Proprioception, Reaction Time and Upper Extremity Functions in Patients with Chronic Neck Pain; Randomized controlled study"", both the effect of EMG Biofeedback muscle training application on the symptoms of patients with neck pain will be investigated and data that will be a reference for future studies in this field will be obtained.

The study in patients with chronic neck pain had two aims. To investigate the effect of EMG Biofeedback relaxation training (upper trapezius muscle) combined with active EMG Biofeedback exercises + routine exercise program on muscle activation, pain, proprioception, reaction time and upper extremity function in patients with neck pain. To compare the effects of EMG Biofeedback training with standard physiotherapy program.

Structural changes in the head and neck region appear to contribute to the onset or worsening of this condition.

To improve patients' quality of life, early diagnosis is essential. Currently, diagnosis relies on expensive devices, often associated with long waiting times. To address these challenges, an innovative solution is proposed: a smartphone application enabling a simple and accessible diagnosis. This application is currently under validation and has not yet been commercialized.

The purpose of the study is to determine whether this smartphone application can be used in clinical practice for patients with a head and neck lesion to diagnose sleep apnea syndrome and to assess its progression during the medical care. This study is for patients who present a head and neck lesion currently under evaluation in our department at Caen University Hospital.

This research will be integrated into routine follow-up for a period of six months.

The medical device used in this study, Apneal, is a smartphone application currently undergoing validation for the rapid diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome. Its use is simple: the smartphone is placed in airplane mode and secured to the chest overnight. Using the phone's built-in sensors, respiratory sleep data is collected and analyzed.

As part of the initial assessment, a dedicated sleep consultation is included, during which a few questionnaires are completed, followed by an overnight sleep recording using the Apneal application. This will be conducted at the beginning of the care during the assessment phase and again six months after the completion of any potential treatment.

Currently, the most accepted definition of FM requires acute illness, hemodynamic compromise due to cardiogenic shock, and need for hemodynamic support (inotropes and/or temporary mechanical circulatory support (t-MCS) in the absence of an ischemic cause or other pre-existing cardiomyopathies. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of evidence-based management strategies for this disease and the management of patients affected by FM often varies according to local experience and practice with the role of immunosuppression being the most debated issue.

Besides, due to inconsistent results obtained in several studies and frequent spontaneous recovery with supportive therapy alone, immunosuppression is largely debated in the setting of lymphocytic myocarditis (LM). Among available medications for this disease, corticosteroids are often used despite a lack of clear evidence in the context of FM. Similarly, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects on myocarditis. In adults, a recent meta-analysis based on case series showed that IVIG therapy significantly reduced in-hospital mortality, improved the left ventricular ejection fraction, and significantly increased the survival rate in patients with FM. More recently, FM among patients with COVID-19, including post-infectious multisystem inflammatory syndrome, has been reported in young adult patients.

Yerba mate is rich in bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, xanthines, and saponins. There are no clinical trials conducted in Paraguay with our Ilex paraguariensis plantations that have analyzed the influence of harvest time on the yerba mate production process and the infusion mode, in relation to its effect on dyslipidemias. General Objective: To establish the effectiveness of Ilex paraguariensis harvest time and the mode of consumption of the produced yerba mate on the lipid profile of consumers in the Department of Caaguazú, Paraguay. Methodology: The research approach will be quantitative, using a triple-blind randomized clinical trial design. Participants will be regular consumers of yerba mate, divided into groups based on harvest time (beginning or end of the harvest) and consumption mode (mate, tereré, or both). Lipid profile measurements will be taken at baseline and at 30, 90, and 180 days after consumption. Yerba mate samples will be analyzed and classified according to their bioactive properties before being blinded to the researchers and participants.

NCT06896149,"Mild Fetal Hydronephrosis, Gestational Diabetes and Spontaneous Resolution vs Moderate-severe Fetal Hydronephrosis, Obstructive Causes and Worse Postnatal Outcome",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06896149,FHYDO,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Renal pelvis dilatation can be a relatively common finding on obstetric antenatal ultrasounds occurring in 1% to 5% of all pregnancies, with a known predilection for the male sex. Fetal hydronephrosis can be ascribed to structural obstructive conditions or functional origin causes. The latter are characterized by the transience of the clinical picture, which appears milder in degree, onset at later gestational ages, a course of substantial stability and spontaneous regression, sometimes as early as during pregnancy or early postnatal life. Fetal hydronephrosis related to structural obstructive causes, on the other hand, classically presents an earlier onset, a worsening course during pregnancy and often requires postnatal surgical correction. Additional ultrasound findings that contribute to prognosis include those indicative of an associated congenital anomaly of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT). The risk of postnatal pathology in mild prenatal hydronephrosis is reported to be between 11% and 15%. It increases up to 27-45% in fetuses with moderate prenatal hydronephrosis and up to 53- 88% in cases of severe hydronephrosis. In the outpatient clinical practice of prenatal ultrasonography, is hypothesized an association between mild, mono- bilateral fetal hydronephrosis as an isolated ultrasound finding and gestational diabetes. In this population, this study aims to highlight the stability of the sonographic picture, relative improvement with effective glycemic control with diet or medical therapy, and subsequent spontaneous resolution in early postnatal life. A possible causal link between the two conditions could lie in the association of poorly controlled gestational diabetes with fetal hyperglycemia, which would cause increased osmotic diuresis resulting in polyuria and subsequent hydronephrosis. In contrast, is hypothesized an association between earlier-onset moderate-to-severe fetal hydronephrosis, its worsening progression throughout pregnancy and the anatomic abnormalities finding in the fetal urinary tract, in no correlation with maternal gestational diabetes. This condition correlates with increased postnatal complications (e.g., recurrent urinary infections, need for antibiotic prophylaxis, etc.) and a more severe postnatal outcome that may require surgical correction. To date, there is limited scientific literature concerning the functional causes of fetal hydronephrosis, as opposed to obstructive causes, which have been more analyzed and classified. This ambispective observational case-control study aims to evaluate pregnant women accessing the obstetric ultrasound and obstetric day hospital outpatient clinics of the Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli- IRCCS with ultrasound finding of mono-bilateral fetal hydronephrosis during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. In this population we will define the fetal hydronephrosis degree, its evolution, the association with maternal metabolic disorders, in order to estimate postnatal morbidity. All prenatal ultrasound images will be interpreted by the same group of specialists. To assess the degree of fetal hydronephrosis, the classification system developed by SFU in 1993 will be used. The latter is the most commonly used among pediatric urologists for grading neonatal and infant pelvic disorders:

* grade 0: no dilatation, calico walls paired with each other
* grade 1 (mild): dilation of the renal pelvis without dilation of the calyces
* grade 2 (mild): dilatation of the renal pelvis (mild) and calyces
* grade 3 (moderate): moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces; dulling of the fornixes and flattening of the papillae; possible mild cortical thinning
* grade 4 (severe): gross dilatation of renal pelvis and calyces; cortical thinning.

The diagnosis of gestational diabetes will be defined by an altered oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) result or elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1c) values. In addition, the presence of a flat OGTT trend suggestive of an insulin resistance condition will also be considered pathological. The OGTT will be performed between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy, as per the guidelines. In patients at high risk of developing gestational diabetes, early screening will be performed between sixteen and eighteen weeks of pregnancy. Amniotic fluid will be assessed according to one of the following ultrasound criteria:

* calculation of amniotic fluid index (AFI) by summing the vertical depth of amniotic fluid measured in each quadrant of the uterus
* With the single deepest pocket (SDP). Polydramnios is diagnosed when the amniotic fluid index (AFI) is ≥ 250 mm, the single deepest pocket (SDP) is ≥ 80 mm, or when the examiner subjectively assesses an increase in amniotic fluid.

This treatment gap has prompted academics and clinicians to consider whether online and/or school-based interventions can increase access to evidence-based mental health care.

This research is a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Project SOLVE, an online problem-solving intervention, compared to Project Success, an activity that teaches young people study skills. Underdeveloped problem-solving skills have been associated with varying presentations of mental distress, including depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. This association has meant problem solving is often featured as a core component of therapeutic interventions, and strengthening problem solving skills has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in youth who experience mental health concerns.

Stroke ranks second in Europe among the causes of death in the world, fourth in the USA and second in Turkey. More than half of these patients who continue to live become partially or completely dependent on others for self-care and daily living activities. During this process, self-care is of critical importance in patients performing daily living activities and preventing complications. Self-care and needs of these patients are usually met by family members or relatives. The continuous care and needs of patients who are dependent or semi-dependent in self-care and daily living activities cause caregivers to have difficulty and experience burnout syndrome. This situation negatively affects caregivers physiologically, psychologically, socially and economically. The impact of all these negative situations on the caregiver and the difficulty they experience while providing care are defined as caregiver burden in the literature. If this burden causes the caregiver individual to have difficulty in performing their own daily living activities, it causes the caregiver's self-care ability to decrease or even be unable to perform them. As a result of the literature review, it was noticed that studies evaluating the difficulties experienced by caregivers and their self-care were generally conducted with caregivers who care for individuals with chronic diseases such as oncology and Alzheimer's. For this reason, determining the caregiver burden and providing regular support to caregivers, and providing planned training and counseling can help to suggest solutions to all these problems. Therefore, the aim of the study is to examine the effect of information provided to caregivers of stroke patients on the care burden and self-care ability.çalışmayı kabul etmeyen hastaların yakınları çalışmaya dahil edilmedi.",NO,Progressing Stroke,OTHER: Written and verbal training given to caregivers,"Burden of Care Scale (Burden Interview), The scale provides a minimum (0) and maximum (88) score.

NCT06896045,Multicenter Study Evaluating the Relationship Between Perceived Daily Stress Level and Glycemic Level in Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06896045,EVASTRESS,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects around 200,000 people in France. The only treatment is insulin, administered either by multiple injections, by pump alone or, more recently, by automated insulin delivery systems (AIDs), which have resulted in a very significant improvement in glycaemic control and quality of life. These closed-loop (CL) devices are capable of effectively regulating the conventional factors associated with glycaemic disturbance, namely dietary intake and physical activity. However, they do not account of stress, which some subjects with T1D perceive as a major disrupter of their blood sugar levels. One of the reasons for this is undoubtedly that stress, unlike diet or physical activity, cannot be anticipated. Since stress is difficult to predict, it is also more difficult to study. Its onset, intensity, duration and progression are linked to the subject's experience, psychological state and environment. Not all patients respond to stress triggers in the same way. Some patients appear to be more reactive than others to these agents, particularly when they are exposed to them chronically or repeatedly, in an anxiety-provoking environment. This is known as chronic psychosocial stress, and it is this type of stress that seems to be most closely associated with glycaemic disturbance in subjects with T1D, most often in the form of hyperglycaemia and, more rarely, hypoglycaemia. However, there are no solid epidemiological or experimental data to support these observations.

The study we propose is a prospective multicentre clinical trial in 125 subjects with T1D treated with insulin pumps or multi-injections at 14 French university centres. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between interstitial glucose levels measured by CGM and perceived stress, assessed 4 times a day, away from mealtimes in order to avoid the impact of dietary glycaemia, using a ""stressometer"".

NCT06895902,Suture Lid Spring for Lid Closure in Patients With Facial Nerve Palsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06895902,SESPL,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The eyelids protect the cornea and eyelid closure is essential to ocular health and clear vision.

Patients with permanent Bells palsy or facial nerve palsy from other reasons such as tumours or trauma may be unable to blink and protect their cornea.

Irreversible visual loss can occur if the cornea is not kept lubricated.

Current treatment options for patients whose eyelid blink does not recover include lubricating the eye every hour or two with drops and lubricating ointment at night, patching the eye closed, sewing parts of the eyelid together (tarsorrpahy), upper lid gold weight or a dental wire spring.

It is inconvenient to lubricate the cornea constantly, and the lubricating drops and ointment usually cost more than $80.00 per month. Lubrication often blurs vision, because the patient must look through a film.

Patching the eye closed and tarsorraphy deprives the patient of peripheral vision, can impede social interaction, and is objectionable cosmetically.

Upper-lid gold weights can be placed underneath the eyelid skin and work by gravity. A gold weight will only work when the patient initiates a forced blink. Gold weights may not work when the patient is lying down because there is no gravity to assist lid closure. The eyelid skin is the thinnest skin in the body and can extrude through the skin over time.

Eyelid springs made of metal dental wire exist but are not frequently used because they often extrude through the thin eyelid skin. Also, dental wire springs require attachment to the bone near the side of the eye. It is not uncommon that dental wire springs have to be removed or replaced.

The investigators propose a new spring to close the eyelid made out of the surgical stitches (sutures) commonly used in medicine and eyelid surgery. The stitch will be made into a custom shape and attached underneath the skin near the centre of the lid, without attachment to the bone.

Upper lid gold weights, dental wire springs, and our proposed suture spring are all foreign bodies and can all become infected or extrude through the skin. Because the suture spring is thinner than a gold weight and because it does not have sharp edges like a metal spring, there should be less risk of extrusion.

CoMPACT consists of 25 sessions of intermittent theta-burst transcranial stimulation (iTBS) consisting of high inter-pulse frequency administered five times daily over five consecutive days.

The trial will include 78 patients with TRD who will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:

* Group 1: Real CoMPACT targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
* Group 2: Real CoMPACT targeting a novel site, the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL).
* Group 3: Sham CoMPACT targeting the left DLPFC (50%, Group 3a) or left IPL (50%, Group 3b).

The hypothesis is that real prefrontal or parietal CoMPACT targeting will significantly alleviate depression symptoms compared to sham targeting, without compromising safety, feasibility, or tolerability.

The trial incorporates a personalized approach, using electrical field (E-field) modeling based on individual structural brain scans to tailor and standardize iTBS, ensuring accurate targeting of cortical volume and consistent induced electrical field strength. To delineate the treatment mechanism of action at the brain network level, multi brain mapping models will be implemented. Electroencephalography (EEG) records of spontaneous and TMS-evoked electrical brain activity will be obtained before, during, and after iTBS sessions to understand how the high frequency burst protocol functionally engages the stimulated cortex.

NCT06895759,Impact of CO2 Absorption on Gas Exchange and Ventilation Patterns While Breathing Into a Snow Air Pocket,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06895759,AVACO2R,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Asphyxia is by far the most common cause of death after critical avalanche burial. The presence of an air pocket increases the survival chances, but expired air rich in carbon dioxide (CO2) progressively displaces oxygen (O2) in the air pocket, a phenomenon known as displacement asphyxia. In addition, an increase in the inspired concentration of CO2 (FiCO2) reduces the alveolar partial pressure of O2 (PAO2), as explained by the alveolar gas equation. Underlining this, a recent experimental porcine study showed that an increased FiCO2 is the leading cause of the decrease in PaO2. By removing CO2 in an experimental avalanche burial, normoxia persisted even after 90 minutes of burial, while, in the absence of CO2 removal, hypoxemia and hypercapnia occurred after only 10 minutes. Additionally, hypercapnia increases pulmonary vascular resistance, reduces cardiac output and can lead to life-threatening hemodynamic instability. Hypercapnia can speed up the cooling rate, and the combination of hypothermia with hypoxia and hypercapnia may result in a worse neurological outcome in completely buried avalanche patients compared to patients suffering solely hypothermic cardiac arrest.

Taken together, these findings suggest that removing CO2 from the air-pocket could prevent, or at least delay, the hypercapnic condition with its deleterious consequences and consequently increase the survival after complete avalanche burial.

The hypothesis is a reduction in the number of injuries in the experimental group, as well as improvements in muscle mechanical properties, performance, and neuromuscular function in young soccer players.The study will be a randomized clinical trial with a convenience sample of approximately 65 male athletes aged between 14 and 18 years, divided into control and experimental groups. Athletes with no history of injury in the three months prior to the study will be included, while those with a history of previous surgery or lower limb fractures in the past five years, or who are undergoing physiotherapy at the time of the study, will be excluded.Muscle mechanical properties (myotonometry), flexibility (sit-and-reach test), ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (Weight Bearing Lunge Test), motor control (Y Balance Test), and the reactive strength index (Myjump App) will be assessed before, immediately after, and at 8 and 16 weeks post-intervention. Myofascial self-release will be performed bilaterally on the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves for 2 minutes per region, twice a week, using a structured massage roller. All procedures will be demonstrated beforehand during the study.

For the Myoton procedure, the athlete will simply lie in a supine and prone position on the examination table. The athlete will only be asked to remain still in the ""face-up"" or ""face-down"" position, feeling only the light contact of the device's probe, which is painless and will be demonstrated beforehand.

In the Y Balance Test, athletes will be asked to balance on one foot atop a grid placed on the floor, with their hands on their hips, and reach as far as possible with the non-supporting leg in three marked directions on the floor, without lifting the heel of the supporting leg.

For the Ankle Range of Motion - Weight Bearing Lunge Test, the athlete will place the tested foot on a measuring tape positioned on the floor and will be instructed to touch their knee to the wall in front of them without lifting the heel of the tested foot. Three attempts will be allowed, and the longest distance from the big toe to the wall will be recorded.

In the Sit-and-Reach Test, the athlete will sit on the floor with bare feet and both legs extended. They will be instructed to keep their hands side by side and try to reach the greatest possible distance on the ruler in front of them by bending forward without bending their legs, holding the position for one second to measure the distance. Three attempts will be allowed, and the greatest distance reached will be recorded.

For ground reaction strength, the athlete will be asked to jump off a 40 cm high box, and as soon as their feet touch the ground, they will be encouraged to jump upward as quickly and as high as possible.

NCT06895668,Self-harm and the Prison Environment Mixed Methods Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06895668,SHAPE,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Self-harming behaviour is a major problem in UK prisons: the number of self-harm incidents has more than doubled over the past decade. People who self-harm in prison are at greater risk of subsequent death by suicide. Risk assessment processes for the prison population are rudimentary and critically under-informed. Research evidence shows that a person's life history and current mental health make some more vulnerable than others to such behaviour. However, the role of the prison environment in contributing to self-harm risk is poorly understood. A wide range of environmental factors might be important, such as the degree of contact with the outside world, stimulation in the daily regime and conflicts with peers and prison staff. In a pilot study that the investigators carried out in a male prison, prison environment characteristics such as placement in a single-occupancy cell and changing cell or cellmate more frequently were associated with self-harm. These environmental factors now require further study in larger-scale research in men and women's prisons. Understanding which environmental factors are relevant to self-harming behaviour will help prison and healthcare staff to make better informed assessments of self-harming risks and better management plans to reduce such behaviours.

This study aims to establish the impact of the prison environment on self-harming behaviour amongst both men and women in prison using a mixed methods approach. The investigators now want to establish the precise influence of such factors in both male and female prisoners to help to improve the management of such behaviour. This will be done by interviewing and following up groups of male and female prisoners for a 12 week period (the cohort study). The investigators will then use focus groups to explore prisoner, staff and other stakeholder views on the findings (the focus group study). Finally, female self-harming prisoners will be interviewed to explore the detailed perspectives of women (the interview study). The studies will take place at three prisons: HMP Wandsworth and HMP Pentonville (both medium security men's prisons) and HMP Bronzefield (a high security women's prison).

Cohort study: Adults entering either prison are eligible to participate. The investigators will recruit a random sample of 458 men and women (based on a power calculation informed by previous pilot work). Participants will complete two 1-hour baseline assessments before being followed up for 12 weeks. The researchers will conduct two further in-person assessments and examine the participant's health and custodial records at the prison and link this with local wing-level prison data. The results will establish which of a range of possible prison environmental factors are related to self-harming behaviour.

The following prison-related predictors of self-harm behaviour will be examined in the cohort study:

* Placement in a single-occupancy cell
* Frequency of cell changes
* Placement in solitary confinement
* Violence perpetration
* Other disciplinary infractions
* Violent/sexual victimisation
* Work status in prison
* Time in purposeful activities
* Social visit status
* Legal status
* Time out of cell (cumulative exposure)
* Staffing ratio (cumulative exposure)
* Staff experience (cumulative exposure)
* Staff responsivity to emergency bells (cumulative exposure)

Focus group study: The researchers will then use focus groups to explore the perspectives of prisoners and staff on our research findings and their implications for day-to-day practice. Adult self-harming prisoners, peer support workers, supervising officers and healthcare staff at the same prisons, alongside other stakeholders working in the field - including carers - will be eligible to participate in audio-recorded focus groups.

Interview study: The investigators will explore in more detail the impact of prison-related factors on self-harm behaviour amongst female prisoners (having already completed such interviews with male prisoners in our pilot work). 10 adult self-harming women at HMP Bronzefield will be recruited to take part in audio-recorded semi-structured interviews.

In view of the close correlation between the functions of the body, which cannot be examined piecemeal but as an integrated system, a holistic approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of the patient. The goal of our protocol is to identify all psychosocial risk factors that could worsen the patient's condition at the time of diagnosis by examining all possible related dimensions: cognitive function, anxiety and depression, pain perception, treatment adherence, the sexual sphere, family dynamics, social support, dysfunctional communication, quality of life while also considering attribution of causes.

Methods: At least 86 patients will participate in the survey. At T0, they will undergo neuropsychological, psychological and associated clinical condition assessment through standardized tests and ad hoc questionnaires. After 1 month (T1), 2 months (T2) and 6 months (T3), the same tests will be repeated.

NCT06895278,Articular Damage in Patients With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis After Transition to Adult Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06895278,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common childhood chronic rheumatic disease, encompassing all forms of arthritis that persist for more than 6 weeks, with onset before age 16, after exclusion of other causes of arthritis. It is a heterogeneous disease, whose complexity is only partially encompassed by the actual classification criteria and it is characterized by prolonged synovial inflammation that can lead to joint destruction.

Whilst the assessment of structural joint damage is part of the routinary evaluation of disease severity and progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to the extent that it is considered a key end-point outcome in treatment efficacy studies, this is not the same for JIA. Some recommendations have been elaborated based on expert opinion, but only recently they have been translated into clinical practice. Such a discrepancy in approaching chronic arthritis has been for many years due to the lack of articular damage radiographic scoring system validated for pediatric age. Actually, joint space narrowing, bone erosions and demineralization, which is typical of adult articular damage, are not the same changes observed in pediatric population where early growth plate closure, epiphyseal deformity and growth asymmetries can be the major signs.

The transition process from the pediatric to the adult health care team is a critical moment in the clinical history of patients with JIA, often hampered by the absence of specific criteria for the assessment of disease activity, the lack of specific treatment recommendations for JIA adult patients, the poor adolescent-specific training for adult rheumatologists, and the lack of communication between pediatric and adult centers. Adult patients with JIA have their own specific identity and should not be inappropriately re-categorized as having RA, ankylosing spondylitis or another condition once transitioned to the adult rheumatologist.

The aim of this study is to quantify the articular damage of adult patient with JIA after closure of growth plates. This represent a sort of starting burden carried by the patients who receive transition to the adult rheumatologist care and which should be minimized in order to reduce long-term complications.

NCT06895109,Cognitive Functions in Severe Acquired Brain Injury After Cranioplasty,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06895109,NeC,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Cranioplasty is the main reconstructive neurosurgical procedure, performed in approximately 80% of patients who have previously undergone demolitive surgeries in an emergency setting, particularly in the case of decompressive craniectomy . It mainly aims to ensure the protection of brain tissue and improve the aesthetic appearance. Statistical correlation analyses between timing of cranioplasty and neurological recovery are probably in favor of early cranioplasty. Cranioplasty improves motor and cognitive rehabilitation outcomes. However, it carries an increased risk of postoperative complications, such as seizures and infections. Other studies show that cranioplasty performed 3 to 6 months after craniectomy can significantly improve motor and cognitive recovery.

The timing of the intervention plays a fundamental role in enucleating cognitive improvement. In fact, greater cognitive changes have been observed in patients who underwent cranioplasty within 6 months of the injury. Therefore, cranioplasty must be considered a key factor for neuropsychological recovery and should be performed early in order to make the most of the rehabilitation window. In the literature, there are studies that have evaluated how cranioplasty can facilitate cognitive recovery, regardless of timing. In particular, a significant cognitive recovery was observed in the period immediately following cranioplasty, while the improvement stabilizes after a certain period of time and recovery begins to slow down. In patients with severe acquired brain injury (GCA), cranioplasty seems to significantly improve neuropsychological and motor function, even after a long time from the procedure.

The scale is a self-assessment scale. It can be completed in a short time. Instead of obtaining a single score at the end of the scale, each parameter has its own scoring. A score of 0 indicates poor health status, while 100 indicates good health status.

NCT06894953,AMPER Proof of Concept Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06894953,AMPER,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The AMPER (Agent-based Memory Prosthesis to Encourage Reminiscing) system has been built to help people with Alzheimer's disease by improving their memory recall and quality of life. Alzheimer's often leads to the loss of autobiographical memories, which can affect a person's sense of identity. AMPER seeks to address this by creating a digital memory aid that uses an engaging, animated character on a tablet to help individuals with Alzheimer's reminisce about their past. By presenting personally relevant stories, images, audio, and videos, the character helps trigger memories and encourages interaction with caregivers.

This is proof of concept study using a randomised controlled trial methodology. Twenty participants will be randomised to the control and 20 randomised to the intervention condition. The intervention group will use a personalised version of the AMPER app with tailored content and the control group will use a non-personalised version without specific adaptations. Over 12 weeks, participants will use the app at home with their caregivers. Researchers will measure changes in their memory and cognitive abilities before and after these 12 weeks.

The primary goal is to see if personalised reminiscence improves the perceived quality of the reminiscence experience and autobiographical memory ability compared to the same app with a non-personalised approach. This will be measured using a combination of automatically gathered app use data and weekly caregiver feedback. Secondary goals are to investigate any difference between participants in the intervention and control condition in their technology acceptance, quality of life, self-esteem, everyday functioning and cognitive ability.

Feedback from this research will help refine AMPER and inform future studies, with the ultimate goal of creating a widely accessible tool that supports memory and well-being in Alzheimer's patients.
